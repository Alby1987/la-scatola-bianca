Chapter 1: Getting Started

White Box requires two kinds of participants: (1) The Referee and (2)
the Player. For Players, the first step in playing the game is to create
a Player Character (PC). This is a simple matter of rolling some dice to
determine your character’s attributes, picking a character class, race
(if non-human) and buying in-game equipment. If you’re the Referee,
however, you’ve got a bit more preparation to do—that’s covered in
Chapter 7.

Rule Number One

The most important rule in White Box is that the Referee always has the
right to modify the rules. In fact, it’s encouraged! This is your game,
after all. There are gaps in the rules—holes left open on
purpose—because much of the fun of “old school” gaming is being able to
make up rules as needed.

Dice

White Box uses several different types of dice, and they are abbreviated
herein according to the number of sides they have. For example, a
four-sided die is noted as “d4.” If this text requires a player to roll
“3d4” that means to roll three (3) four-sided dice and add the results
together. Other die types (six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided,
twelve-sided, and twenty-sided) follow in the same manner.

There is no die with 100 sides. When asked to roll d100, roll two (2)
ten-sided dice, treating the first roll as the “tens” and the second as
the “ones.” So, if one were to roll a “7” and then a “3”, the result
would be “73.”

The roll of two zeroes is treated as a result of “100,” so you cannot
roll a “0” on percentile dice. The lowest result possible is a “1.”

About the Optional Rules

White Box is very easy to learn and play. The basic rules are simple and
clear. As you create your character and read through the rules, you will
see that there are several “Optional Rules” described. These are for
customizing the game to fit the way you want to play, but if you are the
Referee and this is your first time running a game like this, stick with
the basic rules and customize later. The optional rules, plus any new
rules that you and your group invent, are often called “House Rules,”
because each gaming group will use a different mix of alternate and
invented rules. This is a good thing, eventually you’re supposed to
customize your game to fit what you want, not to follow the “official”
rules forever and ever.

Character Sheets

A character sheet is a piece of paper designed to organize and contain
any and all necessary PC information, for the benefit of both the
Referee and Player. For White Box, the character sheet could be
something as simple as a 3x5” index card—with equipment and spells
written on the back. Or you can download the sheet below at
http://whiteboxgame.blogspot.com/

Attributes

The basic abilities are numbers which represent the Strength,
Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity, and Charisma of a
character. The standard way to create attribute scores is to roll 3d6
for each attribute in the previously mentioned order. Once those rolls
have been made, it is often obvious which type of character best fits
the abilities—though, the player always has the option to play any class
desired. Once the player decides on a class, points from other
attributes may be shifted around, but only into the “Prime Attribute” of
that character class. Shifting points around may not lower another
ability score below 9, however.

Some Referees allow more flexibility (optionally). One example is to let
the players roll 3d6 a total of six times and arrange the rolls however
they want. This allows the player to put the best results into abilities
that best suit the type of character the player wants to be.

Attribute Bonus

White Box doesn’t give many bonuses for having high attribute scores.
You can modify the game to increase the effect that these scores have.
One quick way to do this is to use the table below whenever you need a
quick rule. Feel free to change the values. For example, if you prefer
the “average” range to be 9–12, adjust the table.

| Table 1: Attribute Bonus |                 |           |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Attribute Roll           | **Description** | **Bonus** |
| 3-6                      | Below Average   | -1        |
| 7-14                     | Average         | 0         |
| 15-18                    | Above Average   | +1        |

Experience Bonus

Each character gets a bonus percentage to their “experience points” (XP)
that will increase the amount of experience points gained during an
adventure. All characters add together the following: 5% if the
character’s Prime Attribute is 15+, 5% if Wisdom is 15+, and 5% if
Charisma is 15+. A Cleric with Wisdom of 15+ gets the 5% bonus twice:
once because it is the Prime Attribute for a Cleric, and again because
it is applied to all characters. The maximum attainable bonus is 15%.
All awards of XP to the character during play will be increased by the
amount of the bonus (by 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%, whichever it is).

An alternate method for the experience point bonus is simply to give the
character a bonus of 10% if the Prime Attribute is 15+, 5% if the Prime
Attribute is 13-14, and –10% if the Prime Attribute is lower than 9.
There is no bonus for scores between 9 and 12. If you use this method,
do not also give the +5% bonuses described in the basic rules that
follow: if you do it this way, the maximum XP bonus is 10%.

Strength

Strength represents the character’s physical power. It is the Prime
Attribute for Fighters, so when a Fighter character has Strength of 15+,
the character gets a 5% bonus to XP. Fighters can use their Strength
Bonus to modify their “to-hit” and damage results when using melee
weapons.

Intelligence

Intelligence represents IQ, reasoning, and the ability to solve puzzles
or understand difficult concepts. A high Intelligence score gives a
character an additional language for every point above 10. Intelligence
is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, who will get a 5% bonus to XP if
the character’s Intelligence is 15+. Magic-users can use their
Intelligence Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers
a loss on his saving throw).

Wisdom

Wisdom determines a character’s insight, perception, and good judgment.
Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Any character with a Wisdom
score of 15+ gets a 5% bonus to XP, and a Cleric character with Wisdom
15+ gets another 5% (total of 10%) because it is the Prime Attribute for
the Cleric class. Clerics can use their Wisdom Bonus to improve “spell
effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

Constitution

Constitution refers to the health and endurance of a character. A high
Constitution score (15+) gives the character a +1 to each hit die, and a
low score (6 or lower) gives a –1 penalty to each hit die.

Dexterity

Dexterity is a combination of coordination and quickness. It is the
Prime Attribute for Thieves (if they are used). A high Dexterity score
(15+) gives a character a bonus on “to-hit” rolls when attacking with a
bow or other ranged weapon, and a low score (8 or less) gives a penalty
of -1 to such rolls. Dexterity can be used to modify a character’s Armor
Class.

Charisma

Charisma refers to a character’s leadership ability. Any character with
a Charisma of 15+ receives a 5% bonus to XP. Charisma also determines
the number of Non-Player Character (NPC) hirelings a character can
acquire. These hirelings include specialists (ship captains, assassins,
etc.) and non-human creatures, but do not usually include basic
men-at-arms. Charisma modifies the loyalty of these NPCs (See
“Loyalty”).

| Table 2: Charisma Bonus |                        |             |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Charisma                | **Hirelings (Max \#)** | **Loyalty** |
| 3–4                     | 1                      | -2          |
| 5–6                     | 2                      | -2          |
| 7–8                     | 3                      | -1          |
| 9–12                    | 4                      | 0           |
| 13–15                   | 5                      | +1          |
| 16–17                   | 6                      | +2          |
| 18                      | 7                      | +2          |

Hit Points

Hit points (HP) represent the amount of “damage” a character can take
before dying: they are determined by the number of hit dice (HD) the
character has at each level, which is found in the description of each
character class later on. If a player begins the game with a 1st level
Fighter (1+1 HD) the player would therefore roll 1 HD (1d6) and add “+1”
to the end result to determine his PC’s starting hit points. When the
character accumulates enough XP to gain a level, usually a new hit die
is rolled and added to the total (sometimes a new level only gives an
additional hit point, though, not a whole new hit die).

Alignment

Alignments in the game represent cosmic forces and are described as Law,
Chaos, and Neutrality. In general, Law also corresponds to being “good,”
Chaos corresponds to being “evil,” and Neutrality simply means that the
character is indifferent between the two moral polarities. It is quite
possible for the Referee to make the alignment system more complex:
perhaps Lawful only means that you are in favor of centralized
hierarchies in society, in which case you could actually be Lawful Evil
as well as Lawful Good. It is a matter of preference if you want to make
the alignment system more complex.

Character Retirement

If a character reaches the highest level listed on the table for that
character class, what happens? Does advancement stop? Does the character
have to retire? Each group has its own play style and a preference for a
given range of character levels for their games. If the Referee wants to
extend the tables to allow higher-level characters, then go for it!

Chapter 2: Character Classes

There are four possible character classes in the game: the Cleric, the
Fighter, the Magic-user, and the Thief (optional). The Referee is, of
course, free to invent or allow other character classes in the game.

The Cleric

Clerics are armored priests who serve a particular alignment, religion,
or patron deity. Players may make up the details if the Referee doesn’t
use a particular mythology for the campaign. Mythologies and other
details of a campaign world often come later if the Referee is just
starting.

The Cleric is a champion of his faith and moral alignment. The character
might be a sinister witch-hunter, an exorcist of demons, a shining
knight of the faith, or a secret agent of some temple hierarchy. Since
many of the Cleric’s abilities are oriented toward healing and
protecting, they tend to play a support role during combat. However,
they are able to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the party’s Fighters if
need be—at least for a while. Clerics must be either Lawful (good) or
Chaotic (evil). There are no Neutral Clerics unless the Referee decides
otherwise.

Cleric Abilities

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Because of secret religious practices, Clerics may only use blunt
weapons (club, flail, mace, etc.) and the only missile weapon they are
allowed is oil. Clerics have no armor restrictions.

**Spell Casting**

Clerics cast divine spells from a specific spell list, as per the Cleric
Advancement table. Each day, the Cleric prays for a certain set of
spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Clerics of specific
gods might have entirely different sets of spells as designed by the
Referee, but the standard Cleric uses the standard spell list.

**Saving Throw**

Clerics receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. poison and paralysis
(unless the alternative “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

**Banishing Undead**: Clerics can use their holiness to “Turn” the
undead, causing them to flee.

**Establish Temple**

At tenth level, the rank of “Patriarch” is awarded. A Cleric, who
chooses to build and dedicate a temple to a deity, may attract a body of
loyal followers who swear fealty to the character. If the Cleric changes
alignment after establishing a Temple, the character will lose any
followers (and probably face a revolt).

**Experience Bonus for Wisdom**

Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Clerics with Wisdom of 15 or
higher receive a 10% to experience, 5% as normal, and 5% because it is
the Prime Attribute for the class.

**Turning the Undead**

Lawful clerics (only) have the ability to “turn” the undead, causing
them to flee or destroying them outright. When a turning attempt is
made, roll 3d6 and consult the Turning Undead table for the result.

If the result on the dice is equal to or greater than the number shown
on the table, all undead creatures of the targeted type are turned and
will flee for 3d6 rounds (or cower helplessly if they are unable to
flee).

For Lawfully aligned Clerics, if the table indicates a “D” then the
undead creature is destroyed automatically and will crumble to dust.

**Turn Undead (Variant)**

Referees who wish to limit the use of the Turn Undead ability might try
to count this as merely a 1st level Cleric spell.

**Chaotic Clerics and the Undead (optional)**

Many Referees allow Chaotic clerics as well as Lawful clerics to turn
the Undead. If Chaotic clerics are allowed to turn the undead, treat a
result of “D” on the table a bit differently; instead of destroying the
undead creature, the Chaotic cleric has forced it into servitude. It
will follow the character’s commands, although the Referee will decide
the limitations on this power. Perhaps the cleric can only keep a
certain number of undead under control at one time (or a certain number
of hit dice) – the cleric’s level is a good number to use for this
limit, whether it stands for a maximum number of Undead creatures or for
a maximum number of total hit dice.

The Fighter

The Fighter is a warrior, trained in battle and in the use of armor and
weapons. Your character might be a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming
samurai, or a medieval knight. Because they are the best equipped of all
the character classes to deal out and absorb damage, Fighters often end
up on the front lines, going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil
cultists. If you are the party’s Fighter, the down-and-dirty work is up
to you.

Fighter Abilities

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Fighters are trained in warfare and, as such, have no restrictions on
the kind of weapons or armor they can use.

**Combat Fury**

Against foes of one hit dice (HD) or fewer, Fighters get one attack per
level each combat round.

**Saving Throw**

Fighters receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. death and poison
(unless the alternative “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

**Establish Stronghold**

At ninth level, a Fighter who chooses to build a castle is considered to
have reached the rank of “Baron” or “Baroness,” bestowed by the local
ruler or monarch. The character may choose to attract a body of
men-at-arms, who will swear their fealty as loyal followers.

**Experience Bonus for Strength**

Strength is the Prime Attribute for Fighters, which means that a
Strength score of 15+ grants an additional 5% experience.

The Magic-User

The Magic-user is a mysterious figure, a student of arcane powers and
dark magic. They can be devastating opponents. However, at lower levels,
they are quite vulnerable and must be protected by the other party
members. As Magic-users progress, they generally become the most
powerful of the character classes—holding sway over the political
destinies of great kingdoms and able to create wondrous magical
artifacts.

Magic-user Abilities

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Magic-users tend to spend their waking hours in study of arcane tomes
and scrolls. As such, they have little time to train with weapons or
learn how to properly engage in physical combat. Magic-users may only
wield daggers or staves, and are not allowed the use of armor.

**Spell Casting**

Unlike the Cleric, the Magic-user owns a book of spells—which does not
necessarily include all of the spells on the standard lists. Reading
from this book, the Magic-user presses a select spell formula into his
mind, effectively “preparing” it to be cast. Once a prepared spell is
cast, the spell formulae disappears from the Magic-user’s mind, and must
be prepared again before another attempt can be made to cast it.
However, it is possible to prepare a spell multiple times using the
available “slots” in the Magic-user’s memory. If the Magic-user finds
spell scrolls during an adventure, he can copy them into his spell book.

**Saving Throw**

Magic-users receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. spells—including
those cast from wands and staves (unless the Alternate “Saving Throw
Matrix” is used).

**Experience Bonus for Intelligence**

Intelligence is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, which means that an
Intelligence score of 15+ grants them an additional 5% to all experience
points awarded.

**Establish Tower**

At tenth level, a Magic-user gains the title of “witch” or “wizard” and
can build a stronghold to house her library and laboratory. She will
attract a mix of mercenaries, strange servants and even a few monsters
(like flying monkeys). This motley crew will swear fealty to her and
serve her with whatever loyalty she can inspire.

Thief (optional)

While there are many who wield sword and spell while exploring tombs and
dungeons, the thief hopes to recover lost riches through the use of
guile and stealth. Though trained in arms, he is not a combatant by
trade. Instead he strikes from the shadows and his keen eyes see dangers
that his companions do not. Thieves are rarely noble, but are more often
pragmatic professionals looking for opportunities to rapidly amass great
wealth. Still, their unique skill set makes them very useful to
dungeoneers and explorers and there are some among their ilk who hold to
a code of “honor among thieves.”

Thieves often go equipped with but a few weapons and light armor, and
rely on picks and tools for survival. When combat does arise, they fade
into the darkness, ready to plunge a dagger into the backs of
unsuspecting foes. The rare thief who manages to amass fortune and glory
is likely to retire and start a guild of others with similar skills.

Thief Abilities

**Weapons and Armor Restrictions**

Thieves are agile and skilled in combat. They may wield any weapon.
However, they prefer to rely on their reflexes and only wear leather
armor.

**Back Stab**

Any time a thief attacks an opponent who is unaware of their presence,
the thief receives a +2 to their Base Hit Bonus. If the attack is
successful, the thief may roll his weapon damage twice.

**Saving Throw**

Thieves receive a +2 bonus to any saving throw made to reduce or avoid
the effects of any trap, magical or mundane.

**Thievery**

Thieves are stealthy and light-footed. The thievery ability may be used
for any number of clandestine or stealth-based actions. From picking
pockets or locks, discovering and disarming traps, remaining silent and
hidden while moving or even climbing walls free-handed. The Referee has
the final say as to whether an action falls under the purview of
thievery or not. When the thief attempts to use this ability the Referee
rolls 1d6. If the result of the roll is equal to or lower than their
rating in the thievery ability, the thief is successful in their
attempt. Thieves are not often aware of when their attempts to remain
stealthy fail, and the thief always believes he is successful.

**Establish Guild**:

A thief of ninth or higher level may choose to establish a secret
hideout, often in an urban location. He will attract the attention and
service of other, lower-leveled, thieves who hope to learn from a
master. He is known as a Guild Master, and those who arrive are members
of his Thieves Guild. In return for a cut of their earnings, the thief
will provide these apprentices with protection from local law
enforcement as much as he is able.

**Experience Bonus for Dexterity**

Dexterity is the Prime Attribute for Thieves, which means that a
Dexterity score of 15+ grants an additional 5% experience.

Chapter 3: Character Races

In a fantasy world, humans often aren’t alone. Elves may populate the
great forests, Dwarves may carve their halls and mines into the heart of
the earth, and Halflings may reside in the comfortable hill-houses of
their bucolic shires. By contrast, some fantasy worlds depict an
isolated human race pitted against ancient pre-human evils and the grim,
savage wilderness of worlds at the dawn (or dusk) of human civilization
itself. Some fantasy worlds, as a third example, accentuate the bizarre,
with a wide variety of fantasy races available to the players—such
worlds are filled with conflict and contradictions, always with a new
wonder to be found beyond the next corner. The Referee determines what
non-human races, if any, you can choose for your character.

The Dwarf

Dwarves tend to live in underground cities. As such, Dwarves easily take
note of certain features of stonework: sloping corridors, moving walls,
and traps made of stone (in particular: falling blocks, rigged ceilings,
and tiny slits designed to release arrows, darts, or poison gas). What
the Dwarf does or does not perceive is for the Referee to decide but for
an optional die roll to use, see the Keen Detection racial ability.

Dwarven Abilities

**Character Advancement**

Dwarfs can choose between two classes, the Fighter or Thief (if used),
and they are typically allowed to advance as high as 6th level.

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Like human Fighters, Dwarves have been trained in warfare and have no
restrictions on the weapons or armor they may use.

**Fighting Giants**

Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not
good at fighting dwarves, and only inflict half the normal damage
against them.

**Keen Detection**

Dwarves are good at spotting traps, slanting passages, and construction
while underground (1-4 on a d6 when searching, 1-2 on a d6 if just
passing by).

**Saving Throw**

Dwarves do not use magic and are somewhat immune to its effects; they
receive a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. magic (whether or not the
alternate “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

**Languages**

For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Dwarves should be
able to speak with gnomes, goblins, orcs, and kobolds.

The Elf

The Referee can interpret Elves in many different ways. Are they
faerie-folk of Irish legend, the Vanir of Norse mythology, or perhaps
something more akin to the Elves of Tolkien’s imagination?

As a baseline, most Elves are associated with magic as well as being
skilled with the sword and bow. The Elven adventurer may choose, on any
given day—perhaps when the moon rises—whether to use the capabilities of
the Fighter or Magic-user. As a result, the Elf has two alternate
advancement paths (experience points, hit dice, saving throws, “to-hit”
bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether he donned steel that day or
summoned up the power to cast spells.

Elves must use a spell book to prepare spells, just as a Magic-user.
Spells disappear from his casting capability once they are cast, until
prepared again.

Elven Abilities

**Character Advancement**

Elves may use either the Fighter or Magic-user class advancement charts,
to be announced at the start of an adventure. They are typically allowed
to progress to 4th level as Fighters and 8th as Magic-users.

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

When an Elf adventures as a Magic-user, the character has the same
weapon and armor limitations as a Magic-user. The exception to this
would be magic armor, which may still be worn even when the Elf is
acting as a Magic-user.

**Hereditary Foes**

Elves gain an extra +1 (“to-hit” or to damage) when fighting goblins,
orcs, intelligent undead, and lycanthropes. Elves are also immune to
paralysis caused by undead such as ghouls.

**Keen Detection**

Elves are good at spotting hidden and concealed doors (1-4 on a d6 when
searching, 1-2 on a d6 if just passing by).

**Languages**

For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Elves should be able
to speak with gnolls, goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins.

The Elf (Variant)

Some Referees may want to allow the Elf to advance as a blend of Fighter
and Magic-user instead of switching back and forth. In that model, the
following advancement table might be used instead. Aside from Character
Advancement and Weapon and Armor Restrictions, Elven Race Abilities
remain the same.

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Elves would have the advantage of both magic and armor at the same time,
so the Referee may limit the Elf to chain mail. Elves may not use
two-handed weapons (two-handed sword, polearms, etc.) or shields while
casting spells.

The Halfling

Halflings are short, often stout, and live in shires, rustic communities
that are usually remote from those of larger folk. A few of them have a
mildly adventurous spirit, enough to venture forth for a while at least,
exploring the world beyond the farms and fields of the local shire.

Halfling Abilities

**Character Advancement**

Halflings can choose between two classes, the Fighter or Thief (if used)
and they are typically allowed to advance as high as 4th level.

**Weapon and Armor Restrictions**

Like human Fighters, the Halfling has no weapon or armor restrictions.

**Fighting Giants**

Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not
good at fighting small creatures such as halflings and dwarves, and only
inflict half the normal damage against them.

**Deadly Accuracy with Missiles**

Halflings receive a +2 “to-hit” when firing missile weapons in combat.

**Near Invisibility**

When not engaged in combat, Halflings can be quite stealthy, making
themselves hard to spot and moving in almost total silence. The success
of this ability is determined by the Referee, or a die roll can be used,
with a roll of 1-5 on a d6 indicating success.

**Saving Throw**

Halflings are somewhat immune to magic, and receive +4 on saving throws
vs. magic (even if the “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

**Languages**

For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Halflings should be
able to speak with creatures that fit the style of the Referee’s
campaign.

Chapter 4: Equipment

Each character starts with some gold pieces (3d6x10) at the beginning of
the game, used to buy equipment. One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver
pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces (cp). Prices for equipment are listed
on the tables below in amount of gold pieces. The Referee is encouraged
to include additional items and equipment.

Equipment Weight

A “normal” level of miscellaneous equipment is assumed to weigh 10
pounds. If treasure is added to this, each coin and gem is assumed to
weigh 0.1 pound.

Weapon Damage (optional)

In the Original Game, all weapons did 1d6 damage, regardless of type.
White Box provides some slight variation. To play the Original Game as
it was written, simply ignore all variations in weapon damage – they all
inflict 1d6 damage regardless of whether the weapon is a two-handed
sword or a dagger.

Important

Numbers for the “Ascending” armor class system always appear in brackets \[like this\].

Calculating Armor Class

To calculate a character’s Armor Class, you must decide which system to
use. The two systems have the same armor protection, but in one of them
a high armor class is better, and in the other a low armor class is
better. Just decide which you prefer:

Descending AC System

In this system, an unarmored human has an AC of 9. The armor you buy
lowers your AC and the lower the AC, the harder you are to hit. To
calculate your Armor Class, look at the Armor table above, in the
“Effect on…” column. For whatever type of armor you bought, subtract the
number shown from your base AC of 9. That’s your new Armor Class.

Ascending AC System

For the ascending system, an unarmored person has an AAC of \[10\]. AAC
means “ascending armor class,” and it is used in brackets as a reminder
of which system is in use. Your armor adds to your AAC, so the higher
your AAC, the harder it is for your enemies to hit you. To calculate
your Ascending Armor Class, look at the Armor table, in the “Effect on…”
column. For whatever type of armor you bought, add the number shown in
brackets to your base AAC of \[10\]. That’s your new Armor Class.

Converting Armor Class Systems

To translate between the Ascending and Descending AC systems, the
ascending armor class (AAC) and descending armor class (AC) values
should add up to 19. Thus, AC 7 is the same as AAC \[12\] (12+7=19).

Hiring Assistants

Many characters, particularly when first starting an adventuring career,
are in need of hirelings to assist in carrying loot or fighting
monsters. Characters are free to create advertisements and inquire at
local taverns to find available hirelings. Prices are in gold pieces and
are for one week of service.

| Table 14: Hiring Assistants           |               |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| Hireling Type                         | **Cost (gp)** |

| Non-combatant (servant, torch bearer) | 2             |
| Sage                                  | 500           |
| Sailor                                | 3             |
| Soldier                               | 5             |
| Spy                                   | 125           |

These rates are for humans only. Demi-humans cost more to hire—and it
may take more than just the promise of gold coins.

Chapter 5: Playing the Game

Once characters have been created, the Referee will describe where the
characters are and what they can see. The game might start in a rural
peasant village, a vast and teeming city spiked with towers and
minarets, a castle, a tavern, or at the gates of an ancient tomb. From
that point on, Players describe what their characters do. Going down
stairs, attacking a dragon, talking to other Player Characters (PCs) or
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) controlled by the Referee —all of these
kinds of actions are decided by the players. The Referee then describes
what happens as a result: the stairs lead down to a huge tomb, the
dragon attacks the characters, etc. The rules below are guidelines
handling events like combat, gaining experience, movement, healing,
dying, and other important parts of the game.

Basically, you and the Referee work together, with the Referee handling
the details of a dangerous fantasy world, and you handling what your
character does in it. The epic story of your character’s rise to
greatness (or death in the effort) is yours to create in the Referee’s
world.

Gaining Experience

Characters are awarded Experience Points (XP) for killing monsters and
accumulating treasure. Monsters have set Experience Point values in
their descriptions, and one gold piece acquired is equal to one XP.
Experience is awarded for accumulating treasure because every gold piece
gained by a character is an index of his player’s skill. Awarding
experience only for killing monsters fails to reward a party of
adventurers that successfully lures a dragon away from its hoard so that
its treasure can be stolen without a fight— it fails to reward
characters that operate by intelligence, stealth, trickery, and
misdirection.

Each character class has a Prime Attribute listed in its description,
and the character creation process details how to determine the
character’s total XP bonus. There are two different ways of doing it,
but each one results in a percent bonus. If a character’s bonus is 10%,
for example, and the Referee awards 1000xp to each character, that
particular character would get 1100xp (10% of 1000 is 100, so the
character gets a bonus of 100xp).

Time

The Referee will be required to make general rulings on the passage of
time during the course of a campaign (e.g. “A few hours later...”) and
should be governed by common sense. There are, however, two important
time measurements that merit brief definitions--the “turn” and “combat
round.” A turn (lasting ten minutes) is used to track and measure
actions, movement and resources when the intrepid adventurers are in
dangerous places. The shorter combat round (lasting one minute)
represents the back and forth action of battle.

Movement

Base movement rate for all races is calculated on the table below in
tens of feet per turn, allowing for two moves per turn.

| Table 15: Movement Rate |               |                    |
|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Weight Carried (lb.)    | **Elf/Human** | **Dwarf/Halfling** |
| 0–75                    | 12            | 9                  |
| 76–100                  | 9             | 6                  |
| 101–150                 | 6             | 3                  |
| 151–300                 | 3             | 3                  |

Careful movement is used for exploring, checking for traps and hidden
things. Running movement is used when you are trying to get somewhere
fast or get away from something wicked. Normal movement is pretty much
everything else.

Combat movement is used when characters are engaged in battle and time
has transitioned to Rounds instead of Turns.

| Table 16: Movement Rate Adjustments |                       |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Movement Type                       | **Adjustment**        |
| Careful                             | Half of Movement Rate |
| Normal                              | Movement Rate         |
| Running                             | Double Movement Rate  |
| Combat                              | 1/3 Movement Rate     |

Outdoor Movement

Base movement rate is in miles per day, but can be doubled during a
forced march. For outdoor combat round movement rates, take the base
rate, divide by three and multiply by 10 yards. For example a base
movement rate of 9 normally allows 9 miles of travel per day, 18 miles
forced, and 30 yards of movement per combat round. The Referee should
decrease the normal rate of movement for travel over difficult terrain,
like swamps or mountains.

Dungeon Doors

Dungeon doors are large, heavy and even unlocked are hard to open.
Humans and Elves will open an unlocked door on a roll of 1-2 in 6, while
Dwarves and Halflings have a base 1 in 6 chance. At the Referee's
option, characters will apply any strength bonus or penalty to this
roll. It is assumed that most monsters can easily open doors, and that
once opened, doors will shut on their own.

Light

Torches and lanterns illuminate a 30-foot radius. Torches burn for one
hour (six turns), while lanterns burn one pint of oil in four hours (24
turns). Players using a light source cannot normally surprise monsters,
but they can of course still be surprised. It is assumed that all
monsters see in the dark, unless they are charmed or otherwise in the
service of players.

Listening at Doors

Humans have a 1 in 6 chance of hearing noise, non-humans hear noise on a
roll of 1-2 in 6. Note that success indicates the player heard
something, but they may not know what caused the sound.

Secret Doors

Secret doors can be detected by any player who is actively searching for
one with a roll of 1-2 on a d6. Elves, however, find secret doors on a
roll of 1-4 on a d6 when searching, or may sense with a 1-2 on a d6
chance that something is amiss by merely passing by a secret door. It
takes one turn for each 10'x10' area searched.

Traps

Most traps and pits are triggered on a roll of 1-2 on a d6 when any
player passes over the triggering mechanism. Note that Dwarves can
detect stonework traps similarly to how Elves detect secret doors - they
have a 1-4 on a d6 chance to detect such traps if actively searching, or
1-2 in 6 if merely passing by. Players falling into a pit trap will take
1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.

Note on finding secret doors and traps

Ideally, players will be descriptive enough during a search that they
will automatically find a trap or secret door. For example, if moving a
wall sconce opens a secret door, and the player says “I examine the
sconces on the north wall for anything unusual”, a Referee might
automatically allow them to figure out how the secret door opens. If,
however, they merely state “I search the north wall for secret doors”,
the Referee can require a die roll. Some features might be so well
hidden as to always merit a die roll, or at least a roll with some sort
of adjustment.

Combat

When the party of adventurers comes into contact with enemies, the order
of events in the combat round is as follows:

1\) The Referee determines if one side or the other is entitled to a
free attack or move as a result of surprise—this is either a judgement
or a die roll of some kind, depending on the circumstances. Normally,
anyone is surprised if they roll a 1 or a 2 on a d6.

2\) Determine initiative. One roll is made for each side, not for each
individual in combat.

-   Party with initiative acts first (missile fire, casting spells,
    movement, melee attacks, etc.) and results take effect.

-   Party that lost initiative acts; results take effect.

-   The round is complete; keep turn order for the next round if the
    battle has not been resolved.

Intent (optional)

Some Referees prefer to have all parties make a “statement of intent”
before they roll initiative in order to force players to decide what
they’re doing before they know who goes first.

How Initiative Works

At the beginning of the first combat round, each side rolls initiative
on a d6—high roll wins. The winning side acts first, casting spells,
moving, and attacking. The other side takes damage and casualties, and
then has its turn.

Initiative rolls may result in a tie. When this happens, both sides are
considered to be acting simultaneously. The Referee may handle this
situation in any way he chooses—with one caveat. The damage inflicted by
the combatants during any simultaneous initiative is inflicted even if
one of the combatants dies during the round. It is possible for two
combatants to kill each other in this situation. If you want to play
things more simply, just re-roll initiative if there is a tie until one
side or the other wins the initiative.

Alternate Combat Sequence (optional)

The sequence of battle is one of the most commonly house-ruled parts of
the game. Here is one possibility, also based on the Original Game:

1.  Roll for surprise. Anyone not surprised gets a free round of combat
    in the normal order (see below). If neither side, or both sides, are
    surprised, move on to the next step.

2.  Roll for initiative (one roll for each whole side), and follow the
    sequence described:

First, any “prepared” spells are cast. It takes a full combat round to
prepare a spell, but one can be prepared ahead of time. Spellcasters who
won the initiative cast their spells first. They may then start
preparing a spell for the next round, if desired.

Next, missile weapons are fired (if the bow was already in the
character’s hands and ready to go). This also happens in order of
initiative.

Then melee combat takes place, in order of initiative. Finally, movement
takes place, in order of initiative.

If it is important to find out which character in the party goes before
another one, just compare their Dexterity scores to see which is higher.

The Attack Roll

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses to
the result. These “to-hit” bonuses may include a strength bonus (for
attacks with hand held weapons), a dexterity bonus (for attacks with
missile weapons), and any bonuses for magic weapons. The player then
subtracts any “to-hit” penalties they might have from their roll.

The attack roll is then compared to a table to see if the attack hits.
If the attack roll is equal to or higher than the number on the table,
the attack hits. If you are using the Ascending AC system, rather than
refer to these tables, there is a quick method presented below that you
can use. The Referee decides which will be used.

If an attack hits, it inflicts damage (as determined by the weapon’s
damage die). The damage is subtracted from the defender’s hit point
total (See “Damage and Death”).

Ascending AC Combat – Quick Method

If you’re using the Ascending AC system, it may be easier to calculate
your “to-hit” rolls according to a simple formula. The numbers are the
same as the Descending AC tables—this is just a different way of
calculating the results. Here’s how it’s done:

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses to
the result. These “to-hit” bonuses now include the character’s Base
“to-hit” Bonus, as shown on the character Class table, and may include a
strength bonus (for attacks with handheld weapons), a dexterity bonus
(for attacks with missile weapons), and any bonuses for magic weapons.
The player then subtracts any “to-hit” penalties they might have from
their roll. If the result is equal to or greater than the opponent’s
Ascending AC, the attack hits.

Note: This quick system only works for the ascending AC system. In order
to use this system, you’ll need to write down your Base “to-hit” Bonus,
and adjust it as you gain levels, but after doing that, you won’t have
to check the table to see if you score a hit. All you need to know is
whether the total result was equal to or higher than the target’s armor
class.

Damage and Death

When a character (or creature) is hit, the amount of damage taken is
deducted from his hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character
dies.

A Less Harsh Method (optional)

Referees have different ideas concerning how lethal a game should be.
For this reason, many allow characters to become “unconscious” at 0 HP,
with death staved off until the character reaches some predetermined
negative number.

For example, many Referees employ a house rule which allows a
character’s HP to fall below 0 by as many points as their level before
the character dies; a 4th level character might die only if he falls
below -4 HP. Generally, though, a character with fewer than 0 HP is
considered to be bleeding to death at 1 HP per round until the wounds
are bound up.

Healing

In addition to the various magical means of restoring HP, a character
will recover 1 full Hit point per day of uninterrupted rest. Four weeks
of rest will restore all of a character’s HP—regardless of how many the
character lost.

Binding Wounds (optional)

Referees can allow characters to bind 1d4 HP worth of wounds following a
battle. This is of particular use in low-magic campaigns or in
adventures where none of the Players has chosen to run a Cleric.

Note that the character can only recover HP lost during this particular
battle. Recovered HP cannot cause a character to have more hit points
than normal.

Some Referees view hit points as an abstract measurement of a
character’s stamina with the final attack that brings a character to
zero hit points representing an actual significant blow from a weapon.
As such, they may allow characters to heal more hit points per day of
rest and allow for their hit die to be rolled for binding wounds.

Invisible Opponents

An invisible opponent can only be attacked if its general location is
known, and the attack suffers a -4 penalty “to-hit.” Note that more
powerful monsters (those with sensitive smell, hearing, or those with
more than 6 HD) will frequently be able to detect invisible opponents;
the Referee should determine the chance of this based on the creature
and the situation.

Oil

Thrown oil that is subsequently set alight by a thrown torch or similar
will burn for two rounds, doing 1-6 damage per round on a successful hit
of AC 8 \[11\]. The Referee should adjust the chance to hit based on the
size of the creature being targeted, obviously large creatures such as
Ogres and Giants will be easier to hit than, say, giant spiders.

Melee Attack

A melee attack is an attack with a hand-held weapon such as a sword,
spear, or dagger. Two combatants within ten feet of each other are
considered to be “in melee.”

Missile Attack

Missile attacks are with ranged weapons such as crossbows, slings, or
thrown axes. When using missiles to fire into melee, it is not possible
to choose which opponent (or friend!) will receive the brunt of the
attack.

Morale

Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and
will always fight to the death. The majority, however, will not continue
to fight a hopeless battle and will seek to retreat, surrender, or flee.
The Referee will decide when monsters abandon battle and retreat, based
upon the situation and the monster’s intelligence. Referees should also
use morale to determine the actions and loyalty of hirelings or other
companion NPCs.

If there is uncertainty about the morale of NPC’s or monsters, the
following table can be used at the Referee’s option.

| Table 20: Morale Check |                     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Roll                   | **Morale**          |
| 2 or less              | Surrender           |
| 3-5                    | Flee                |
| 6-8                    | Hold                |
| 9-11                   | Fight for advantage |
| 12                     | Attack!             |

Negotiation and Diplomacy

Some combats can be averted with a few well-chosen words (even lies). If
the party is outmatched, or the monsters don’t seem likely to be
carrying much in the way of loot, the party might elect to brazen their
way through in an attempt to avoid combat or at least delay it until
more favorable conditions arise.

Jousting

A joust is a contest in which two fighters ride at one another while
wielding lances. The object is to make contact with the opponent’s armor
or shield that is hard enough to break the lance or to actually unhorse
your opponent.

The joust, as a sport, consisted of three tilts. In White Box, this
equates to three rounds of combat. Each round consists of an attack with
a lance. If the lances are blunted, they deal 1d6-1 points of damage,
but cannot kill the jouster. At 0 hit points, the jouster is knocked
unconscious and falls from his steed (no additional damage). If the
lances are not blunted, they deal normal damage and might kill.

Any jouster that suffers damage must pass a Saving Throw or be knocked
from his steed and suffer 1d6 damage from the fall.

| Table 21: Jousting Points   |            |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Condition                   | **Points** |
| Attack Roll of 12 or Higher | 1          |
| Inflict Damage              | 2          |
| Unhorse Opponent            | 3          |

Medium war horses grant a +1 bonus to attack. Heavy war horses grant a
+2.

The jouster with the most points after three rounds wins the joust. If
one opponent is knocked unconscious or killed, they automatically lose
the joust.

In a duel, the loser must forfeit his mount and his armor, and permit
himself to be ransomed for as much as his companions or family can pay,
usually commensurate with the fighter’s social class.

Spells

Spell casting begins at the start of the combat round. It is possible to
prepare a spell while within melee range of an opponent (10 feet) but if
the caster suffers damage while preparing a spell, the spell is lost.
Unless stated otherwise, the spell is cast (takes effect) in the
caster’s initiative phase.

Note that in the Alternative Sequence of Combat, spell casting works
differently. In that system, it takes a full round to prepare a spell,
the spell is cast at the beginning of the round before anything else
happens, and the caster may spend the rest of the round preparing a new
spell (or doing something else such as moving or even fighting).

Loyalty

The Referee may wish to make “loyalty checks” for NPCs put into
dangerous situations or ones offered bribes to change sides during a
conflict. When a loyalty check is made, roll 3d6 and consult the Loyalty
table for the result. Remember that these checks can be modified by a
Player’s Charisma score.

| Table 22: Loyalty |                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Roll              | **Loyalty**              |
| 3                 | Traitor                  |
| 4–5               | -2 on next loyalty check |
| 6–8               | -1 on next loyalty check |
| 9–12              | Average                  |
| 13–15             | +1 on next loyalty check |
| 16–17             | +2 on next loyalty check |
| 18                | Loyalist                 |

Good treatment, respect, and a fair share of treasure earned should
garner bonuses to loyalty checks, while abuse, physical or otherwise,
will bring about penalties, abandonment, or worse. NPCs should be
treated as distinct individuals, and not mere extensions of the Player
Character.

If an NPC is in a situation in which a Morale check may be appropriate,
the Loyalty modifier can be applied to the Morale roll (optional).

Saving Throws

From time to time, a spell or some other kind of hazard requires you to
make a "saving throw." A successful saving throw means that the
character avoids a threat or lessens its effect. Each character class
has a saving throw target number which gets lower as the character gains
levels. To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or
greater than the character's saving throw target number, the saving
throw is successful.

Alternate Rule: The Saving Throw Matrix

The White Box saving throw system is an adaptation of the original,
which had several categories of different risks instead of a single
basic saving throw as used here. Numbers inspired by the original system
are given below (the Single Saving Throw number is provided for
comparison):

This table does not integrate directly into White Box: if you were to
house-rule it in, you would have to eliminate the White Box class
bonuses on saving throws (i.e., the bonuses listed for each class in the
class description but not racial bonuses for non-humans).

Remember

White Box is a free-form roleplaying game, meaning that there aren’t
very many rules. The Referee is responsible for handling situations that
aren’t covered by the rules, making fair evaluations of what the
characters do and deciding what happens as a result. This is not a game
in which the players are “against” the Referee, even though the Referee
is responsible for creating tricky traps, dangerous situations, and
running the monsters and other foes the PCs will encounter during the
game. In fact, the players and the Referee cooperate with each other to
create a fantasy epic, with the Referee creating the setting and the
players developing the story of the heroes. If they aren’t skillful and
smart, the epic might be very short. But it’s not the Referee’s job to
defeat the players—it’s his job to provide interesting (and dangerous)
challenges, and then guide the story fairly.

Chapter 6: Spells & Magic

Clerics and Magic-Users are the only classes that can cast spells.
Spells have three phases. First they are memorized (a character can only
memorize a certain number of spells to bring along on an adventure – see
the description of the character classes to find out how many, and what
level). Second, they are prepared, which is the process of saying the
magic words and making the magic gestures. Third, the spell is cast,
which means it takes effect and the magic happens. In the normal
sequence of combat, the caster starts preparing at the beginning of the
round and casts the spell whenever his/her side has the initiative. In
the alternative combat sequence, it takes a whole round to prepare a
spell, but spells are cast at the beginning of the next round, and the
caster can then take other actions during the round, including preparing
a spell for the next round.

Spell Descriptions

Contained herein are all of the Cleric and Magic-user spells, in
alphabetical order. The chaotic-version spells in parentheses are
available to Clerics only.

Alter Time

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: 30 min.

The caster must announce which of the two options is being cast. Both
options have a 60 foot radius area of effect:

1.  As a Haste spell, as many as 24 creatures may move and attack at
    double normal speed.

2.  As a Slow spell, as many as 24 creatures failing a saving throw may
    only move and attack at half speed.

Animal Growth

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: 2 hours

This spell causes 1d6 normal creatures to grow immediately to giant
size. The affected creatures can attack as per a giant version of the
normal animal.

Animate Dead

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: Referee’s discretion

*Duration*: Permanent

This spell animates skeletons or zombies from dead bodies. 1d6 undead
are animated (per level of the caster above 8th). The corpses remain
animated until destroyed or dispelled.

Anti-Magic Shell

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: Caster

*Duration*: 2 hours

An invisible bubble of force surrounds the caster, impenetrable to
magic. Spells and other magical effects cannot pass into or out of the
shell.

Bless (Curse)

*Spell Level*: C2

*Range*: Target PC or NPC (out-of-combat)

*Duration*: 1 hour

The caster must announce which of the two options is being cast. The
recipient of this spell cannot be in combat when it is cast.

1.  As a Bless spell, the recipient is granted a +1 bonus to all attack
    rolls and, if the target is not a Player Character, improves overall
    morale.

2.  As a Curse spell, the recipient is cursed with a -1 penalty to all
    attack rolls and, if the target is not a Player Character, suffers a
    decrease to morale.

Charm Monster

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Until dispelled

This spell operates in the same manner as Charm Person, but can affect
more powerful monsters. Up to 3d6 monsters of fewer than 3 HD are
affected.

Charm Person

*Spell Level*: M1

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: Until dispelled

This spell affects living bipeds of human size or smaller, such as
goblins or dryads. If the spell succeeds (saving throw allowed), the
unfortunate creature falls under the caster’s influence.

Cloudkill

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: Close

*Duration*: 1 hour

Foul and poisonous vapors boil from the thin air, forming a cloud 15
feet in radius. The cloud moves away from the caster at a rate of 6 feet
per minute unless its direction or speed is affected by winds. Unusually
strong gusts can dissipate and destroy it. Poison-laden, the horrid mist
is heavier than air, and thus sinks down any pits or stairs in its path.
This spell affects only creatures with 5 or fewer HD.

Commune

*Spell Level*: C5

*Range*: Caster

*Duration*: 3 questions

Higher powers grant answers to three questions the caster poses. Higher
powers don’t like being constantly interrogated by mere mortals, so the
spell should be limited to one casting per week. The Referee may rule
that a caster may cast a double strength Commune spell composed of six
questions once per year.

Confusion

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: 2 hours

This spell confuses people and monsters, making them act randomly. The
effects of the confusion may shift every 10 minutes, and the dice are
rolled again to determine any change. Roll 2d6 to determine the
creature’s behavior:

| Table 29: Confusion Reaction |                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Roll                         | **Reaction**                       |
| 2–5                          | Attack the caster (and his allies) |
| 6–8                          | Stand baffled and inactive         |
| 9–12                         | Attack each other                  |

The spell affects 2d6 creatures, plus an additional creature for every
caster level above 8th. Creatures of 3 HD or fewer are automatically
affected by the spell, and it takes effect immediately. Creatures of 4
HD or more automatically resist the confusion effect until it reaches
its full power, which takes a number of minutes equal to 1d4. These
creatures must make a saving throw when the effect reaches full power
and every 10 minutes thereafter or become confused for the remainder of
the spell’s duration.

Conjure Elemental

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until dispelled

The caster summons a 16 HD elemental (any kind) from the elemental
planes of existence, and binds it to his commands. Each type of
elemental may only be summoned once per day. The elemental obeys the
caster only for as long as the caster concentrates on it; when the
caster ceases to concentrate, even for a moment, the elemental is
released and will attack.

Contact Other Plane

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: None

*Duration*: See table

The caster creates a mental contact with the planes, forces, powers, and
geometries of the beyond, in order to gain affirmative or negative
answers to the questions he contemplates. The spell’s effect depends on
how deeply the caster wishes to delve into the planes of existence. Roll
a d20 on the table below.

| Table 30: Contact Other Plane |               |           |            |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Plane\*                       | **Insanity†** | **Right** | **Wrong‡** |
| 1                             | 1–2           | 3–11      | 12–20      |
| 2                             | 1–4           | 4–13      | 14–20      |
| 3                             | 1–6           | 7–16      | 16–20      |
| 4                             | 1–8           | 9–17      | 18–20      |
| 5                             | 1–10          | 11–18     | 19–20      |
| 6                             | 1–12          | 13–19     | 20         |

\* Planes are the “depth” at which the caster chooses to seek the truth;
number of Yes/No questions asked

† Temporary insanity lasts for as many weeks equal to the depth of the
plane where the caster’s sanity failed

‡ This represents the possibility of being mislead or misinterpreting an
answer

Control Weather

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: Referee’s discretion

*Range*: 120 ft. (C), 60 ft. (M)

*Duration*: 1 hour (C), 20 min. (M)

1.  As a Detect Chaos spell, the caster detects creatures of Chaos, or
    those with chaotic enchantments, intentions, thoughts, or auras
    within the spell’s range. Poison is not inherently evil or chaotic
    and cannot be detected by means of this spell.

2.  As a Detect Law spell, the spell works exactly like Detect Chaos
    except that it detects Law.

Detect Invisibility

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 10 ft./caster level

Caster can perceive invisible creatures and objects.

Detect Magic

*Spell Level*: C1, M1

as it is within the spell’s given range.

Disintegrate

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent

The caster defines one specific target such as a door, a peasant, or a
statue, and it disintegrates into dust. Magical materials are not
disintegrated, and living creatures (such as the aforementioned peasant)
are permitted a saving throw. The Disintegrate spell cannot be
dispelled.

Dispel Chaos (Law)

*Spell Level*: C5

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 10 minutes

1.  As a Dispel Chaos spell, the spell is similar to the arcane spell
    Dispel Magic, but works against items, spells, or agents of Chaos.
    However, unlike Dispel Magic, this spell also functions against
    chaotic sendings, possibly including dreams or supernatural
    hunting-beasts.

2.  As a Dispel Law spell, the spell works exactly like Dispel Chaos,
    except that it will dispel Law.

Dispel Magic

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: 10 min.

Dispel magic can be used to completely dispel most spells and
enchantments.

As an example of how one might referee this spell, the chance of
dispelling magic could be a percentage based on the ratio of the level
of the caster trying to dispel over the level of the caster (or HD of
the monster) who hurled the original magic.

Thus, a 6th level Magic-user attempting to dispel a charm cast by a 12th
level Magic-user has a 50% chance of success (6 / 12 = 1/2). If the 12th
level Magic-user were dispelling the 6th level Magic-user’s charm, the
dispelling caster’s chance of success would be 200% (12 ∕ 6 = 2).

Feeblemind

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent until dispelled

Feeblemind is a spell that affects only Magic-users. The saving throw
against the spell is made at a -4 penalty, and if the saving throw
fails, the targeted Magic-user becomes feebleminded until the magic is
dispelled.

Find Traps

*Spell Level*: C2

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 20 min.

Find Traps can allow the caster to perceive both magical and non-magical
traps at a distance of 30 feet.

Fireball

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Instantaneous

A missile shoots from the caster’s finger to explode at the targeted
location in a furnace-like blast of fire. It has a burst radius of 20
feet and damage is 1d6 per level of the caster. The blast shapes itself
to the available volume. A successful saving throw means that the target
only takes half damage.

Fly

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: Touch

*Duration*: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level

This spell grants the power of flight, with a movement rate of 120 feet
per round. The Referee rolls for the duration of the spell in secret and
does not disclose this information to the Player.

Hallucinatory Terrain

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until touched by an enemy or dispelled

This spell changes the appearance of the terrain into the semblance of
what the caster desires. A hill can be made to disappear, or could be
replaced with an illusory forest, for example.

Hold Monster

*Spell Level*: M5

(saving throw applies) or may instead target a single creature who must
make their save at a -2 penalty.

Hold Portal

*Spell Level*: M1

*Range*: Referee’s discretion

*Duration*: 2d6 turns

This spell magically holds a door or gate in position for the spell’s
duration (or until dispelled). Creatures with magic resistance can
shatter the spell without much effort.

Insect Plague

*Spell Level*: C5

*Range*: 480 ft.

*Duration*: 1 day

This spell only works outdoors. A storm of insects gathers, and goes
wherever the caster directs. The cloud is approximately 400 square feet
(20 × 20 feet, with roughly corresponding height). Any creature with
fewer than 2 HD exposed to the cloud of insects will flee in terror (no
saving throw).

Invisibility

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until dispelled or an attack is made

The object of this spell, whether a person or a thing, becomes invisible
to both normal vision and to darkvision. If the Referee is using the
invisibility rules unchanged, the result is that an invisible creature
cannot be attacked unless its approximate location is known, and all
attacks are made at -4 to-hit.

Invisibility, 10 ft. radius

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until dispelled or an attack is made

Identical to the Invisibility spell, which makes the target creature or
object invisible to normal vision and to dark vision, except that it
also throws a sphere of invisibility (with a 10 foot radius) around the
recipient, which moves along with the target.

Invisible Stalker

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: Near Caster

*Duration*: Until mission is completed

This spell summons an Invisible Stalker with 8 HD. The stalker will
perform one task as commanded by the caster, regardless of how long the

cannot be banished by means of Dispel Magic; it must be killed in order
to deter it from its mission.

Knock

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Instantaneous

This spell unlocks and unbars all doors, gates, and portals within its
range, including those held or locked by normal magic.

Levitate

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 20 ft. per level

*Duration*: 10 minutes per level

This spell allows the Magic-user to levitate himself, moving vertically
up or down, but the spell itself provides no assistance with lateral
movement. A wall, cliff side, or ceiling could be used to move along
hand-over-hand.

Levitation allows up or downward movement at a rate of up to 6 feet per
minute (60 feet per turn), and the caster cannot levitate more than 20
feet per level from the ground level where the spell was cast (such
range being applied both to movement into the air and to downward
movement into a pit or chasm).

Light (Dark)

*Spell Level*: C1, M1

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: 2 hours (C), 1 hour + 10 minutes per level (M)

1.  As a Light spell, the caster targets a person or object which then
    produces a light about as bright as a torch with a radius of 20
    feet.

    fall upon the area with a radius of 20 feet.

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent until dispelled

1.  As a Light, Continual spell, the caster targets a person or object
    which then produces a light about as bright as a torch with a radius
    of 20 feet.

2.  As a Dark, Continual spell, the caster instead causes night-time
    darkness to fall upon the area with a radius of 20 feet.

Lightning Bolt

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Instantaneous

A nearly ten foot wide bolt of lightning extends 60 feet from the
fingertip of the caster. Anyone in its path suffers 1d6 points of damage
per level of the caster, though a successful saving throw halves damage.
The bolt always extends 60 feet, even if this means that it ricochets
backward from something that blocks its path.

Locate Object

*Spell Level*: C3, M2

*Range*: 90 ft. (C), 60 ft. + 10 ft. per level (M)

*Duration*: 1 minutes per level

This spell gives the caster the correct direction (as the crow flies)
toward an object the caster specifies with a description. The object
cannot be something the caster has never seen, although the spell can
detect an object in a general class of items known to the caster:
stairs, gold, etc.

Magic Jar

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: See below

*Duration*: See below

This spell relocates the caster’s life essence, intelligence, and soul
into an object (of virtually any kind). The “jar” must be within 30 feet
of the caster’s body for the transition to succeed.

Once within the magic jar, the caster can possess the bodies of other
creatures and people, provided that they are within 120 feet of the jar
and fail a saving throw. The caster can return his soul to the magic jar
at any time, and if a body he controls is slain, his life essence
returns immediately to the jar. If the caster’s body is destroyed while
his soul is in the magic jar, the soul no longer has a home other than
within the magic jar (although the disembodied wizard can still possess
other bodies as before). If the jar itself is destroyed while the
Magic-user’s soul is within, the soul is lost. The Magic-user can return
from the jar to his own body whenever desired, thus ending the spell.

Massmorph

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until negated or dispelled

One hundred or fewer human-sized creatures are changed to appear like
innocent trees. The illusion is so perfect that creatures moving through
the “forest” will not detect the deception.

Move Earth

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent

This spell can only be used above ground. It allows the caster to move
hills and other raised land or stone at a rate of 6 feet per minute for
1 hour.

Move Water

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: See below

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1.  The spell lowers the depth and water level of lakes, rivers, wells,
    and other bodies of water to 1/2 their normal levels. Used this way,
    the spell lasts for 10 turns.

2.  Alternately, this spell creates a gap through water, but only to a
    depth of 10 feet. Used this way, the spell lasts for 6 turns.

Neutralize Poison

*Spell Level*: C4

*Range*: Referee’s discretion

*Duration*: 10 min.

This spell counteracts poison, but does not bring the dead back to life.

Passwall

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 30 min.

This spell creates a hole through solid rock. The hole or tunnel is up
to 10 feet deep and is large enough to allow the passage of an average
sized human.

Phantasmal Force

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: Until negated or dispelled

This spell creates a realistic illusion in the sight of all who view it.
The illusion disappears when it is touched, but if the viewer believes
the illusion is real he can take damage from it.

Plant Growth

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent until dispelled

Up to 300 square feet of ground can be affected by this spell;
undergrowth in the area suddenly grows into an impassable forest of
thorns and vines. The caster can decide the shape of the area to be
enchanted. An alternate version (Referee’s decision) would allow the
spell to affect an area of 300 × 300 feet, for a total of 90,000 square
feet.

Polymorph

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: See below

*Duration*: See below

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1.  The caster assumes the form of any object or creature, gaining the
    new form’s attributes (the use of wings, for example), but not its
    hit points or combat abilities. The Referee might allow the benefit
    of the new form’s armor class, if it is due to heavily armored skin.
    A great deal of the spell’s effect is left to the Referee to decide.
    This form of the spell lasts for roughly one hour plus one
    additional hour for each level of the caster.

2.  Alternately, this spell allows the caster to turn another being into
    a different type of creature (such as a dragon, a garden slug, and
    of course, a frog or newt). The polymorphed creature gains all the
    abilities of the new form, but retains its own mind and hit points.
    Used in this way, the range on this spell is 60 feet. This form of
    the spell lasts until dispelled.

Project Image

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: 1 hour

The caster projects an image of his person to a maximum range of 240
feet. Not only does the projected image mimic the caster’s sounds and
gestures, but any spells he casts will appear to originate from the
image.

*Range*: Caster only

*Duration*: 2 hours (C), 1 hour (M)

1.  As a Protection from Chaos spell, the caster creates a magical field
    of protection around himself to block out all chaotic monsters, who
    suffer a -1 penalty “to-hit” against the caster, and the caster
    gains +1 on all saving throws against such attacks.

2.  As a Protection from Law spell, it does the same thing except that
    lawful creatures suffer the -1 penalty.

Protection from Chaos (Law), 10 ft. radius

*Spell Level*: C4, M3

*Range*: 10 ft. radius around caster

*Duration*: 2 hours

1.  As a Protection from Chaos, 10 ft. radius spell, it has the same
    effect as Protection from Chaos—except that its effect covers an
    area rather than an individual.

2.  As a Protection from Law, 10 ft. radius spell, it has the same
    effect as Protection from Law—except that its effect covers an area
    rather than an individual.

*Duration*: Until completed

If the victim fails his saving throw, the caster may set a task for him.
If a Magic-user casts this spell the victim will die if he ignores the
Quest altogether. If a Cleric casts this spell the victim’s failure to
obey will result in a curse to be determined by the Referee.

Raise Dead

*Spell Level*: C5

*Range*: Line of sight

*Duration*: See below

Raise Dead allows the Cleric to raise a corpse from the dead, provided
it has not been dead too long. The normal time limit is 4 days, but for
every caster level higher than 8th, the time limit extends another 4
days. Characters with low constitution might not survive the ordeal; and
even for those with a strong constitution, a period of two weeks is
required before they can function normally. This spell only functions on
races that can be used for Player Characters (i.e., “human-like”).

Read Languages

*Spell Level*: M1

*Range*: Reading distance

*Duration*: 1 or 2 readings

This spell allows the caster to read directions, instructions, and
similar notations that are written in unfamiliar or even unknown
languages. It is especially useful for treasure maps.

| Table 32 : Affected by Sleep |                     |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Victim’s HD                  | **Number Affected** |

Speak with Animals

*Spell Level*: C2

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 1 hour

(unless he’s got something particularly offensive to say).

Speak with Plants

*Spell Level*: C4

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 1 hour

The caster can speak to and understand the replies of plants. Plants

weight he can lift and move is 20 pounds per level.

Teleport

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: Touch

*Duration*: Instantaneous

This spell transports the caster or another person to a destination that
the caster knows (at least knowing what it looks like from a painting or
a map). Success depends on how well the caster knows the targeted
location:

1.  If the caster has only indirect experience of the destination (known
    only through a picture or map) there is a 25% chance of success—with
    failure resulting in death.

2.  If the caster has seen but not studied the destination there is a
    20% chance of failure. Half of failures will place the traveler 1d10
    × 10 feet below the intended location, possibly resulting in death
    from arrival within a solid substance. The other half of failures
    will place the traveler 1d10 × 10 feet above the targeted location,
    possibly resulting in a deadly fall.

3.  If the caster is familiar with the location or has studied it
    carefully there is a 5% chance of failure, with 1 in 6 failures
    arriving below and 5 in 6 arriving above the targeted location. In
    either case, the arrival is 1d4 × 10 feet low or high.

Transform Rock-Mud

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: 3d6 days, or spell reversal

This spell transforms rock (and any other form of earth) into mud, or
mud to rock. An area of roughly 300 × 300 feet becomes a deep mire,
reducing movement to 10% of normal.

Transform Stone-Flesh

*Spell Level*: M6

*Range*: 120 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent until reversed

This spell transforms flesh into stone or stone into flesh, as desired
by the caster. A saving throw is permitted to avoid being turned into
stone, but if the spell succeeds the victim is transformed into a
statue.

Wall of Fire or Ice

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Concentration

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1.  As a Wall of Fire spell, the caster conjures a wall of fire that
    flares into being and burns for as long as the caster concentrates
    upon it. Creatures with 3 or fewer hit dice cannot pass through it,
    and no creature can see through it to the other side. Passing
    through the fire inflicts 1d6 hit points of damage (no saving throw)
    and undead creatures sustain twice the normal damage. The caster may
    choose to create a straight wall 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a
    circular wall with a 15 foot radius, also 20 feet high.

2.  As a Wall of Ice spell, the caster conjures up a 6 foot thick wall
    of ice. The caster may choose to create a straight wall 60 feet long
    and 20 feet high, or a circular wall with a 15 foot radius, also 20
    feet high. Creatures with 3 or fewer hit dice cannot affect the
    wall, but creatures of 4+ hit dice are able to smash through it,
    taking 1d6 points of damage in the process. Creatures with
    fire-based metabolisms take 2d6 instead of the normal 1d6. Fire
    spells and magical effects are negated in the vicinity of the wall.

Wall of Stone or Iron

*Spell Level*: M5

*Range*: 60 ft.

*Duration*: Permanent (stone) or 2 hours (iron)

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1.  As a Wall of Stone spell, the caster conjures a wall of stone 2 feet
    thick, with a surface area of 1,000 square feet.

2.  As a Wall of Iron spell, the caster conjures an iron wall from thin
    air. The wall is 3 feet thick, with a surface area of 500 square
    feet.

Water Breathing

*Spell Level*: M3

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 2 hours

This spell grants the ability to breathe underwater until the spell’s
duration expires.

Web

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: 30 ft.

*Duration*: 8 hours

Fibrous, sticky webs fill an area up to 10 × 10 × 20 feet. It is
extremely difficult to get through the mass of strands—it takes one turn
if a torch and sword (or a flaming sword) are used, and creatures larger
than a horse can break through in 2 turns. Humans take longer to break
through—perhaps 3 to 4 turns or longer at the Referee’s discretion.

Wizard Eye

*Spell Level*: M4

*Range*: 240 ft.

*Duration*: 1 hour

The caster conjures up an invisible, magical “eye,” that can move a
maximum of 240 feet from its creator. It floats along as directed by the
caster, at a rate of 120 feet per turn.

Wizard Lock

*Spell Level*: M2

*Range*: Close

*Duration*: Permanent until dispelled

As with a Hold Portal spell, but it is permanent until dispelled.
Creatures with magic resistance can shatter the spell without effort.
Any Magic-user three levels or higher than the caster can open the
portal, and a Knock spell will open it as well (although the spell is
not permanently destroyed in these cases).

Chapter 7: Running the Game

Running a game of White Box is a lot easier than running most other
role-playing games, simply because there are not as many rules and your
own discretion overrides them anyway. Most situations are handled by
making “common sense” decisions concerning what happens next.

For example, the players are in combat with a group of orcs and the
fighter wants to trip one of them. It’s up to the Referee to decide what
the fighter needs to do or roll to be successful. If a Player decides
that his character is going to jump through a wall of fire, with several
bottles of flammable oil in his backpack, it’s up to the Referee to
determine whether or not they explode.

This means “making up” a lot of stuff on the spot. If you’re not a good
storyteller or if you’re not up to doing a lot of creative thinking on
the fly, it might be better that you try a different game—one that
provides more rules and guidance for every situation that might arise.
But if you’re a good storyteller, creative and fair, White Box’s small,
Spartan rule-set frees up your creativity to create a fantasy
role-playing experience completely different from the type of game that
depends on a multitude of rules.

White Box also frees up your creativity in terms of customizing the
game. Unlike a more complex game, you can add house rules wherever you
want to without accidentally messing up something else buried in the
rules. If you want to use critical hits and fumbles, add ‘em in. You
won’t break anything—there’s not that much to break!

Designing an Adventure

The “adventure” is just the setting for the game—usually a map and then
notes about certain locations on that map. As the Players tell you where
their characters go and what they do, you’re referring to the map and
your notes to describe what happens as a result. Don’t try to plan for
all contingencies—it’s guaranteed that the players will do something
unexpected during the adventure and you’ll just have to roll with it,
thinking on your feet and making up new things as you go. Just as you
challenge the Players with adventure, they challenge you to keep up with
their collective creativity.

Creating a Campaign

A campaign is the world beyond the adventure—the cities, forests,
coastlines, and kingdoms of the fantasy world. The players will almost
certainly want their characters to explore the wilderness, visit cities,
and do all sorts of things in the fantasy world. At the beginning of the
game, you might want to sketch out a map of a single village (as the
starting point) and some of the surrounding area. (The location of the
first adventure—a dark forest, perhaps) As the players move their
characters around from adventure to adventure, you can expand the little
map into an entire fantasy world with the continents, kingdoms, and
great empires at your disposal.

If you want to take a shortcut, you can set your entire campaign in a
fictional world created by the author of one of your favorite fantasy
stories. Most of these have maps and the author has already created the
details and feel of the world for you. For example, the worlds of
Conan’s Hyboria (Robert E. Howard), of Elric and the Eternal Champions
(Michael Moorcock), and of the Dying Earth (Jack Vance) are popular
fictional settings ready for gaming. Indeed, publishers have already
created pre-packaged campaigns for all three of these examples.

Experience Points

Experience Points are awarded to Players for gaining treasure and
killing monsters, as an earlier Player’s section has described. It may
seem counter-intuitive that treasure somehow makes characters more
experienced, but that’s not what awarding experience for gold pieces is
all about. Gold pieces are an after-the-fact measurement of how
ingenious the character (Player) was in getting them. The gold pieces
are not the source of the experience—they are the measurable product of
it.

That being said, there are many alternative ways for Referees to award
XP. For example, active participation in the campaign might warrant
experience for each hour of real-time play, as could solving puzzles and
aiding allies. A particularly clever solution or epic victory might
warrant double the normal XP amount awarded, while an abysmal failure
might merit half.

Some Referees make all earned Experience Points a part of a community
total to be divided evenly, since not all the characters have the same
opportunities in a given adventure. Others prefer a more competitive
game, whereby each player earns XP according to individual
accomplishments.

If you find that whatever system you’re using leads the players toward
bad decisions—seeking out unnecessary combat or looking for traps to
spring—you might consider adjusting your system. This is true for the
“official” system of awarding experience as well. Remember, the Referee
is the ultimate judge of what works best for a game and any rule can be
changed to fit the group.

Scale of Advancement

Referees all have their own style of campaign, and it would be silly for
one author to impose needless restrictions on anyone playing the game.
However, it is worth noting that this rules set was designed with the
notion that 4th level characters are “heroic” and thus the tables were
capped at level 10. A Referee who wishes to extend the tables to higher
levels is encouraged to do so if it fits the style of the campaign.

Underworld and Wilderness Adventures

Many Referees will create a map of the Underworld or Wilderness in
advance of play. The player characters will then explore the map but are
unaware of its contents.

In the Underworld a map is filled with monsters, traps, treasure, and
any mysterious creatures or locations the Referee can possibly dream
into existence.

The Wilderness map is created using hexagon paper, with each hex
representing 6 miles, and having a primary terrain and possibly an
interesting feature. A feature could be a Wizards tower, a Fighter’s
stronghold, and an Evil High Priest’s dark temple or maybe it could be a
small elf like creature, sitting on a tree stump, playing a magical
flute. Let your imagination run wild when creating features.

Wandering Monsters

In the Underworld, check every hour (six turns), for wandering monsters
and in the Wilderness check every hex. Normally there is a 1 in 6 chance
of encountering something in the Underworld. Check the Getting Lost and
Encounters table for chances of encounters in the Wilderness.

The specific encounter is rolled on a table. Initial encounter distance
is dependent on the circumstance.

Reaction Check

The reaction of monsters to the player character should be determined by
the Referee based on the monster’s intelligence or wisdom and the
situation in which the encounter occurs. Unintelligent monsters will
simply attack. If there is any uncertainty about the monsters reaction,
a roll can be made on the following table.

| Table 33: Reaction Check |              |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Roll 2d6                 | **Reaction** |
| 2 or less                | Hostile      |
| 3-5                      | Negative     |
| 6-8                      | Uncertain    |
| 9-11                     | Positive     |
| 12                       | Enthusiastic |

Getting Lost and Encounters

In the Wilderness, if the characters are following a road or trail,
there isn’t a chance of getting lost. If however, they are exploring
unknown lands, there is a chance of losing their way depending on the
hex terrain.

Whether on well-marked roads or out in the unknown, there is always a
chance for an encounter.

Roll d6 twice per hex to check for becoming lost and/or an encounter

For character class encounters, roll a d6 for their alignment: 1-3 =
Chaotic,

4-5 = Neutral, 6 = Lawful. The character class can be any of the
character races or for an additional option; The Referee can choose a
humanoid. For example, instead of a level 5 human Fighter, it could be a
level 5, Orc Fighter.

Chapter 8: Monsters

There’s not a lot of detail given about the monsters, because the more
detail given, the more your own mental image of the fantasy world is
going to be locked into a single track. We’re not going to say that
giant ants are red, nocturnal, three feet long, and fond of eating
Elves. Because, in your mind, they might be blue, diurnal, five feet
long, and eat only plants unless attacked. Details about monsters toss
roadblocks in front of the imagination. Yes, details can also inspire
imagination, but we’re making the assumption that if you’re interested
in fantasy gaming in the first place, you’ve got a good imagination
as-is and don’t require details about the size of a giant ant.

One important characteristic of all monsters, though, is that they can
see in the dark.

The following is a quick reference guide for how to read monster
descriptions:

Armor Class

“Armor Class” is explained earlier in the rules for combat. If you’re
using the Descending AC system (where lower AC is better), disregard the
numbers in brackets. If you’re using the Ascending AC system (where a
high AC is better), use the numbers in brackets.

Attacks

“Attacks” lists the number of attacks a monster has and the damage they
inflict. Most monsters have one attack and inflict 1d6 damage—there are,
however, some exceptions.

Experience Points

“Experience Points” are presented after a monster’s Hit Dice Equivalent
(HDE) rating, and list the number of XP the adventuring party gains as a
result of killing the creature. In some cases, however, the Referee may
choose to award experience points for defeating a creature without
killing it (circumventing it by creative means, capturing it to bring
home, etc.). Some monsters have multiple Experience Points listed—this
is because certain monsters have a range of hit dice. Order is always
from lowest HD to highest HD.

Hit Dice

“Hit Dice” is the number of dice (d6) rolled to determine an individual
creature’s Hit Points (HP). If there is a plus or minus after the
number, add or subtract that number once from the total rolled.

Hit Dice Equivalent

“Hit Dice Equivalent” is used to separate monsters into “difficulty
levels” so that when creating an adventure the Referee has some
guidelines concerning what characters can and cannot handle. Some
monsters have multiple HDE’s listed—this is because certain monsters
have a range of hit dice. Order is always from lowest HD to highest HD.

Magic Resistance

“Magic Resistance” isn’t one of the entries, but some creatures may have
“magic resistance.” The given percentage chance is the likelihood that
any magic used against the creature (other than bonuses from weapons)
will fail to take effect. To determine whether or not magic used will
have an impact, roll a d100. The magic fails if the result is less than
the given percentage.

Move

“Move” is the monster’s movement rate and is handled like it is for PCs.

Saving Throw

“Saving Throw” isn’t one of the entries, but all creatures have a saving
throw. It is the number on the d20 the monster needs to equal or exceed
in order to avoid a threat or lessen its effect. It is found by
subtracting the monster’s HD from 19. For example, a monster with 4 HD
has a saving throw of 15. Alternatively, a monster can simply be treated
as a Fighter or whatever character class makes sense for that monster,
with the monster’s hit dice being used for its level.

Special

“Special” is just a “flag” of sorts for the Referee that serves as a
reminder that a monster has a special ability.

Note

If you are using the quick formula for calculating attacks using the
ascending armor class system, the monster’s normal “to-hit” bonus is
equal to its hit dice (capped at +15). For example, a monster with 3 HD
attacks with a +3 “to-hit” bonus.

Monster Descriptions

Contained herein are all of the monsters presented in alphabetical
order.

Banshee

*Armor Class*: 0 \[19\]

*Hit Dice*: 7

*Attacks*: Claw

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 11/1,700

Banshees are horrid fey (or undead) creatures that live in swamps and
other desolate places. They can only be harmed by magical or silver
weapons. Banshees have a 49% resistance to magic, and they are immune to
enchantments. Their shriek (once per day) necessitates a saving throw
versus death or the hearer will die in 2d6 rounds. They can travel over
water and other terrain as if it were land, but crossing running water
causes it to lose its magic resistance for 3d6 hours. They look like
gaunt humans with long, stringy hair and glowing yellow eyes. They often
wear hooded cloaks. At the Referee’s discretion, such creatures might be
undead rather than faerie-folk, and are considered to have 9 HD for
turning purposes.

Basilisk

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 6

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Petrifying gaze

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Basilisks are great lizards whose gaze turns to stone anyone meeting its
eye (fighting without looking incurs a -4 penalty “to-hit”). If the
basilisk’s own gaze is reflected back at it, it has a 10% chance to
force the basilisk into a saving throw against being turned to stone
itself.

Beetle, Giant Fire

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 1+3

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

A giant fire beetle’s oily light-glands glow red, and continue to give
off light for 1d6 days after they are removed (shedding light in a 10
foot radius).

Black Pudding

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 10

Attacks: Strike

*Special*: Acidic

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 11/1,700

Black puddings are amorphous globs with an acidic surface. They are
subterranean predators and scavengers. Any weapon or armor contacting a
black pudding will be eaten away by the acid as follows: weapon (1 hit
by weapon on the pudding), chain mail or lesser armor (1 hit by
pudding), plate mail (2 hits by pudding). If a weapon or armor is
magical, it can take an additional hit per +1 before being dissolved.
They are immune to cold and divide when attacked by lightning.

Blink Dog

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 6

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Teleport

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 4/240

Blink dogs are pack hunters, intelligent and usually friendly to those
who are not of evil intent. They can teleport short distances (without
error) and attack in the same turn—in most cases (75%) a blink dog will
be able to teleport behind an opponent and attack from the rear (with
bonuses).

Bugbear

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 3+1

*Attacks*: Weapon or bite

*Special*: Surprise opponents

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 3/120

These large, hairy, goblin-like humanoids are stealthier than their size
would suggest, almost always getting the chance to surprise even the
most alert opponents with a roll of 1–3 on a d6 (50% of the time).

Centaur

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\], 4 \[16\] w/ shield

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Weapon or kick

*Special*: None

*Move*: 18

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Half man, half horse, centaurs are fierce warriors and well-known
creatures of mythology. The Referee may choose any “version” of the
centaur from folklore for his campaign: some are chaotic, some aloof,
and some are soothsayers.

Centipede, Giant (small)

*Armor Class*: 9 \[10\]

*Hit Dice*: 1d2 HP

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Poison (see below)

*Move*: 13

*HDE/XP*: 2/30

Giant lethal centipedes of the small size inflict a lethal amount of
poison with each bite, but inflict no damage if the saving throw is
successful (+4 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

Centipede, Giant (medium)

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Poison (see below)

*Move*: 15

*HDE/XP*: 4/240

This man-sized giant centipede is a deadly predator with armored
segments, a vicious bite, and a lethal (though relatively weak) poison
(+6 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

Centipede, Giant (large)

*Armor Class*: 0 \[19\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Poison (see below)

*Move*: 18

*HDE/XP*: 6/400

A twenty-foot long horror of chitin, multiple legs, and clashing pincers
dripping with venom (+6 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

Chimera

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 9

*Attacks*: Bite (equals \# of heads)

*Special*: Breathes fire, flies

*Move*: 12/18 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 11/1,700

The chimera is a winged, three headed beast; one is the head of a goat,
one the head of a lion, and one the head of a dragon. The dragon head
can breathe fire (3 times per day) with a range of 50 feet, causing 3d8
damage to anyone caught within the fiery blast (saving throw for half
damage).

Cockatrice

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 5

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Bite turns bitten into stone

*Move*: 6/18 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 7/600

Resembles a bat-winged rooster with a long, serpentine tail. Its bite
turns enemies to stone unless a successful saving throw is made.

Death Knight

*Armor Class*: 0 \[20\]

*Hit Dice*: 10

*Attacks*: Two-Handed Sword (1d6+3)

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 12/3200

These terrible undead knights are clad in black armor and wield terrible
two-handed swords with great strength. In addition to increased damage,
each time a death knight successfully strikes a foe with their sword the
target loses one level. Death Knights are also immune to all spells of
5th level or lower. They can cast a Fireball once per day that inflicts
7d6 points of damage. They are immune to damage from mundane weapons and
cannot be banished by a cleric.

Demons

Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are
occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to
serve as guardians by powerful Magic-users or Chaotic Clerics. The more
intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots
of their own. There is no meaningful game distinction between demons and
devils.

Demon, Baalroch

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 9

*Attacks*: Sword or whip (2d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6/15 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 10/1,400

The Baalroch’s name means, roughly, the Bull of Baal: the Baal-aurochs
(the aurochs was a bull that stood twelve feet tall at the shoulder, and
Baal is an ancient and evil pagan deity). These powerful demons somewhat
resemble vast minotaurs with great, spreading bat-wings; they burn with
the fires of hell and are wreathed in flame. The spells of casters below
6th level do not affect them, and against higher-level spell casters
they are yet 75% immune to all spells. In combat, a Baalroch uses whip
and sword; the whip can be used to reach great distances—on a successful
hit the victim is pulled close to the Baalroch and burned by the fires
of the demon’s body (3d6 damage). Baalrochs are sometimes referred to in
ancient texts as Balor or Baalor, which may be the name of a single
demon rather than a term for all of them. A Baalroch could be forced or
tricked into the service of a powerful wizard, but the risk would be
immense.

Demon, Imp

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Poison Tail Sting (1d6-1)

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 6 (12 when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 3/240

These tiny devilish creatures are red or black in skin color with
cat-like eyes, long pointed tails and bat-wings. They are the lowliest
of demons and often serve as slaves to greater demons or servants of
powerful evil clerics and magic-users. Imps are immune to magical
weapons and fire and can cast Detect Magic at will and Invisibility once
per day – both as a magic-user. Their tail has a moderately powerful
poison which can kill if a saving throw is not successful, though the
victim receives a +4 bonus to their roll.

Demon, Succubus

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 6

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6-1)

*Special*: Charm Person

*Move*: 12 (15 when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 6/800

A succubus is a demon of lust who appears as a scantily-clad voluptuous
human woman with a great pair of bat-wings sprouting from her shoulder
blades. Though not effective in direct combat, she can charm with a word
or a kiss and often surrounds herself with a horde of thralls bent to
her will. This ability allows the Succubus to cast Charm Person at will.
If slain, their physical body returns to the infernal planes to which
they are native.

Demon, Lemure

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Claw

*Special*: Regenerate (1 HP/round)

*Move*: 3

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Lemures are vaguely humanoid—their flesh is mud-like, shifting and soft
upon their horrible bodies. Like manes and wretches, lemures are lower
forms of demons, the fleshly manifestations of damned souls. These
demons can only be permanently destroyed by sprinkling their disgusting
bodies with holy water.

Djinni

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 7+1

*Attacks*: Fist or weapon (2d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 9/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100

Djinn are one of the genies of folklore, creatures of the air (and
possibly of the elemental planes). They can carry 700 pounds of weight,
and have a number of magical powers. A djinni can create food and water
of high quality, as well as wooden and cloth objects. They can also
create objects of metal (including coins), but all such magically
created metals disappear in time. Djinn can call up illusions, and
although these are quite excellent they disappear when touched. Djinni
can turn themselves into gaseous form (cannot attack or be attacked, can
enter any area that is not airtight), and can become invisible at will.
Finally, a djinni can turn itself into a whirlwind much like an air
elemental, sweeping away any creature with one or fewer hit dice (the
diameter of the whirlwind is 10 feet). More powerful types of djinn
might be capable of granting limited wishes or even true wishes.

Doppelganger

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Claw

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

A doppelganger can change its form to resemble the physical appearance
(including clothing and gear) of any person. These creatures are immune
to sleep and charm, and are considered magic resistant for purposes such
as breaking through wizard locks and similar spells. They have a very
good saving throw (+5) against magic of all kinds.

Dragons

All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which can be used up to
three times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon will use the
breath weapon or may roll for it (50% chance) in any given round.

Referees should not roll for a dragon’s hit points, like one would for
other monsters. Instead, determine the age category of the dragon—this
will give both the dragon’s hit points per hit dice and how many points
of breath weapon damage per hit dice the dragon inflicts.

For example, an “Adult” dragon has both 4 hit points and 4 points of
breath weapon damage per hit dice. So an “Adult” black dragon with 6 HD
would have 24 HP and deal 24 points of acid damage when using its breath
weapon.

\* The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s
type.

Note that dragons, while dangerous opponents, are not by any means
invincible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common
problem rather than a godlike creature of legend—so the statistics for
dragons reflect a deadly but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of
course, free to create stats for a more “mythical” conception of
dragons. Since dice aren’t rolled for dragon hit points, it is possible
for a truly mythical dragon to have more “numbers” per die than it’s
actually possible to roll on a hit dice.

Dragon, Black

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 6–8

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6+2)

*Special*: Spits acid

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400

Black dragons spit a deadly, corrosive acid. The acid covers everything
in a line 5 feet wide and 60 feet long.

Dragon, Blue

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8–10

*Attacks*: Bite (2d6)

*Special*: Spits lightning

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000

Blue dragons spit a blast of electric lightning, affecting everything in
its path, in a line 5 feet wide and 100 feet long. A successful saving
throw against the blast of lightning indicates half damage.

Dragon, Gold

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 10–12

*Attacks*: Bite (2d6+2)

*Special*: Breathes poisonous gas or fire

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000; 13/2,300; 14/2,600

Gold dragons are of lawful alignment, can always speak, and cast spells
as if they were a Magic-user of equal level to their age category (so
that “Very Old” gold dragons are 6th level Magic-users). They can choose
to either breathe fire in a cone 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide
at the base or breathe chlorine gas in a cloud 50 feet in diameter.

Dragon, Green

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 7–9

*Attacks*: Bite (2d6)

*Special*: Breathes poisonous gas

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700

Green dragons breathe a cloud of poisonous gas that is 50 feet in
diameter. A successful saving throw indicates half damage.

Dragon, Red

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 9–11

*Attacks*: Bite (2d6+1)

*Special*: Breathes fire

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 11/1,700; 12/2,000; 13/2,300

Red dragons are the fire-breathing wyrms of legend. They breathe fire in
a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base.

Dragon, White

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 5–7

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6 +1)

*Special*: Breathes cold

*Move*: 12/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100

White dragons are usually found in cold regions, where they can utilize
their natural camouflage in the ice and snow to ambush their prey. They
breathe intensely cold air and frost in a cone shape 70 feet long and
roughly 30 feet wide at the base.

Dryad

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: Dagger, wooden

*Special*: Charm Person

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 3/60

Dryads are beautiful female tree spirits, and do not venture far from
their home trees. They can cast (as a native magical power) a strong
charm that operates as a Charm Person spell with a -2 saving throw.
Those who are charmed seldom return, or might be kept for a hundred
years and a day within the dryad’s tree.

Dwarf

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 1+1

*Attacks*: War Hammer

*Special*: Stonework insight

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Statistics above are for the common Dwarf with no particular unusual
characteristics. A Dwarf-at-arms would usually have a full 7 HP,
reflecting skill and general toughness. Stronger Dwarves
(sergeants-at-arms, for example) might have more hit dice or unusual
bonuses “to-hit”, even magical abilities if Dwarves are magical in your
fantasy universe. (Norse myths are a good example of this.) Do not
bother to treat more powerful NPC Dwarves as Fighters or character
types; just assign the right number of HD and abilities (if any) and
keep moving along with the fantasy.

Efreeti

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 10

*Attacks*: Fist or sword (2d6)

*Special*: Wall of Fire

*Move*: 9/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000

Efreet are a type of genie, associated with fire (unlike the djinn, who
have powers over the air). Efreet can carry up to a thousand pounds of
weight, and under the right circumstances they can be forced to serve as
a slave (until they figure out how to free themselves). An efreeti can
cast Wall of Fire. They appear as giant humans with cruel features,
their skin flickering with flames.

Elementals

Elementals are living manifestations of the basic forms of matter;
earth, air, fire, and water. They are usually summoned from their native
planes of existence to do the bidding of a powerful wizard. These beings
can also be “chained” within objects or structures to give the objects
magical properties. Elementals are barely intelligent at all, but they
are as powerful as the forces of nature that they actually are.

Elemental, Air

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8, 12, 16

*Attacks*: Strike (2d6)

*Special*: Whirlwind

*Move*: 36 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Air elementals can turn into a whirlwind of air with a diameter of 30
feet, hurling any creature of 1 HD or less for great distances (almost
certainly killing them). Elemental whirlwinds are approximately 100 feet
tall.

Elemental, Earth

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8, 12, 16

*Attacks*: Fist (2d6)

*Special*: Stone destruction

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Earth elementals are hulking human-like shapes of rock and earth. They
batter opponents with their great fists, although damage is reduced by
1d6 if the opponent is not standing upon earth or rock. Earth elementals
can tear apart stone structures, able to rip down even a castle wall in
a matter of 1d4+4 minutes.

Elemental, Fire

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8, 12, 16

*Attacks*: Strike (2d6)

*Special*: Ignite materials

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Fire elementals are formless masses of flame, perhaps with a vaguely
human shape. Their attacks cause flammable materials to ignite if the
material fails a saving throw (as determined by the Referee).

Elemental, Water

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8, 12, 16

*Attacks*: Strike (2d6)

*Special*: Overturn ships

*Move*: 6/18 (when swimming)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Water elementals cannot move more than 60 feet from a large body of
water, and their damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not
standing (or in) a body of water. These powerful beings can overturn
small boats, and can overturn a ship if given 1d4+4 minutes to work at
it. On water, they can attack ships, battering them to pieces within one
hour if not prevented or distracted.

Elf

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 1+1

*Attacks*: Longbow or sword

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

The example above is for a typical Elf; trained warriors would likely
have the maximum 7 HP. Obviously, Elves encountered in the course of a
party’s adventuring will have a variety of powers and different
attributes. The Referee will assign such powers as he sees fit, in
accordance with the way he envisions Elves. They might be the woodland
dwellers of Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or the high Elves of the Lord of the
Rings, or might be the faerie-folk of Irish legend. In any case, as with
Dwarves, don’t bother trying to fit your “advanced” elves into the
constraints of character classes—just make up their attributes to fit
what you need. NPCs aren’t subject to the rules that govern building a
player character; they are your tools for good fantasy, not an exercise
in formula application.

Elf, Dark

*Armor Class*: 5 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: See Below

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 2/60

These cousins of surfaces elves have dark skin and white hair. They raid
all surface-dwellers, but especially elves who they hate the most. They
typically wield short swords (1d6 damage) and light crossbows whose
bolts are coated in a paralytic poison (1d6 damage, save or be paralyzed
for one turn). They are extraordinarily stealthy, surprising their foes
on 1-4 on 1d6. They are also highly resistant to magic, receiving a +5
bonus to all saving throws made to resist it.

Fairie Dragon

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6-1)

*Special*: Sleep Breath, Invisibility I

*Move*: 9 (12 while flying)

*HDE/XP*: 2/120

These small gossamer-winged dragons are no larger than a house cat. They
are playful and friendly, not typically seeking combat. Instead they
breathe a cloud of gas with a 20' radius. All creatures caught in the
cloud must make a saving throw or be put to sleep for 2d6 hours. If
cornered, they will use their ability to cast Invisibility I once per
day to hide themselves. They are fond of shiny objects and twinkling
baubles.

Gargoyle

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Claw

*Special*: Flight

*Move*: 9/15 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 6/400

Gargoyles are winged creatures resembling the carved monstrosities that
bedeck the walls of cathedrals and many subterranean dungeons. They can
be vicious predators.

Gelatinous Cube

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Strike

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Gelatinous cubes are semi-transparent cubes that slosh through
subterranean passages, engulfing debris and carrion to digest. Their
entire substance is acidic: if the cube hits successfully, the victim
must make a saving throw or become paralyzed (6 turns)—during which time
the cube will attempt to devour its victim. Most gelatinous cubes
contain various metallic treasures or gems that they have engulfed but
not yet digested. Gelatinous cubes are immune to lightning and cold.

Ghoul

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: Claw

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 3/60

Ghouls are pack-hunting undead, corpse eaters. They are immune, like
most undead, to charms and sleep spells. The most dangerous feature of
these horrid, cunning creatures is their paralyzing touch: any hit from
a ghoul requires a saving throw or the victim becomes paralyzed for 3d6
turns.

Giants

Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming, huge and dangerous creatures that
often have a taste for human flesh. Most are not particularly
intelligent.

Giant, Cloud

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 12+2

*Attacks*: Weapon (3d6)

*Special*: Hurls boulders

*Move*: 15

*HDE/XP*: 13/2,300

Cloud giants are cunning beasts, often living in cloud-castles in the
sky (hence their name). They throw rocks for 6d6 hit points of damage.
Cloud giants are famous for their ability to smell out food, enemies,
and Englishmen.

Giant, Firbolg

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 9+2

*Attacks*: Weapon (2d6)

*Special*: Hurl boulders, Detect Magic

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 10/1,400

Appearing as giant men (ten feet tall) with flaming red beards, firbolg
dwell in rocky and volcanic regions where they live in clans of miners
and underground fungus farmers. Unlike other giants, they are not
warlike by nature and instead prefer to make prodigious use of their
ability to throw boulders and fight from a distance, which inflict 2d6
points of damage. They are as intelligent as humans and have the natural
ability to cast Detect Magic at will.

Giant, Fire

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 11+3

*Attacks*: Weapon (2d6)

*Special*: Hurls boulders, fire immunity

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000

Fire giants are usually found near volcanic mountains, in great castles
of basalt or even iron. They throw boulders for 5d6 hit points and are
immune to fire.

Giant, Frost

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 10+1

*Attacks*: Weapon (2d6)

*Special*: Hurls boulders, cold immunity

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000

Frost giants dwell in cold regions, where they build (or conquer)
castles in remote places of ice and snow. They throw boulders or great
chunks of ice for 4d6 points of damage and are immune to cold.

Giant, Hill

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 8

*Attacks*: Weapon (2d6)

*Special*: Hurls boulders

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100

Hill giants are the least of the giant races; most are brutish
cave-dwellers who dress in pelts and uncured hides. They throw rocks for
2d8 points of damage.

Giant, Stone

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 9

*Attacks*: Club (2d6)

*Special*: Hurls boulders

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 10/1,400

Stone giants dwell in caves, isolated in the mountain fastness. They
throw rocks for 3d6 points of damage, and can be quite crafty in setting
up ambushes in their native mountains—travelers who wander into the
territory of stone giants seldom return.

Giant, Storm

*Armor Class*: 1 \[18\]

*Hit Dice*: 16

*Attacks*: Weapon (3d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 15

*HDE/XP*: 16/3,200

Storm giants are the largest of giants, the most intelligent, the most
magical, and the most likely to talk with humans rather than simply
devour them. Storm giants can live in underwater sea-castles as well as
on the heights of mountains. They throw boulders for 7d6 points of
damage, and have the power to cast Control Weather.

Gnoll

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 2

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: None

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 2/30

Gnolls are tall humanoids with hyena-like heads. They may be found both
above ground and in subterranean caverns. They form into loosely
organized clans, often ranging far from home to steal and kill with
rapacious ferocity.

Gnome

*Armor Class*: 7

*Hit Dice*: 1

*Attacks*: Short Bow or Short Sword (1d6-1)

*Special*: Phantasmal Force

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Gnome are industrious, peaceful beings. They dwell mostly deep
underground. They rarely stand higher than 3' and have long beards and
pointed noses. They are peaceful by nature, seeking only to mine for
gems and other valuables, engage in the occasional prank. Gnomes are
natural foes of goblins and kobolds, as well as skilled illusionists.
All gnomes can cast Phantasmal Force once per day.

Goblin

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 1-1

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: -1 “to-hit” in sunlight

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: &lt; 1/10

Goblins are small creatures (4 feet tall or so) that inhabit dark woods,
underground caverns, and (possibly) the otherworldly realms of the fey.
They attack with a -1 “to-hit” in the full sunlight.

Golems

Golems are man-shaped creatures built to serve their masters, usually
powerful wizards or high priests. They are often used as guardians.
Golems cannot be hit with non-magical weapons, and are immune to the
sorts of spells used to create them (iron golems being immune to fire,
for instance).

Golem, Flesh

*Armor Class*: 9 \[10\]

*Hit Dice*: 12

*Attacks*: Fist (1d6+2)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 8

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000

A creation stitched together from human limbs and other parts, like
Frankenstein’s monster. Damage inflicted by lightning heals the golem,
and it is slowed by fire and cold. No other type of spell than
lightning, fire, or cold affects a flesh golem. Only +1 or better magic
weapons can harm a flesh golem.

Golem, Glass

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 9

*Attacks*: fist or weapon (1d6)

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 9/1700

Whether crafted from animated stained glass, or massive piles of jagged
shards, these behemoths are sometimes animated to protect churches and
other holy sites. They are immune to non-magical weapons and take only
one point of damage from attacks made with magical weapons which are not
blunt. They take half damage from fire spells, but reduce their movement
by half for one round after suffering it. They are immune to all other
forms of magic.

Golem, Iron

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 13

*Attacks*: Fist or weapon (2d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 17/3,500

Iron golems are huge moving statues of iron. They can breathe a 10 foot
radius cloud of poison gas as well as attacking with great power. Only
+3 or better magic weapons can harm an iron golem. These hulking statues
are slowed by lightning spells, but fire-based spells actually restore
hit points to them. No other type of spell affects them.

Golem, Stone

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 16

*Attacks*: Fist (2d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 16/3,200

Stone golems are massive stone statues animated by very powerful magics
(much more than just animate object, in other words). They are slowed by
fire spells, and damaged/healed by rock to mud spells and the reverse.
Spells that affect rock (and fire spells) are the only magic that
affects them. They can only be hit by weapons +2 or better.

Golem, Wood

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 10

*Attacks*: fist (1d6+2)

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 10/2000

These lumbering constructs are often mistaken for treants and typically
protect hidden groves and glens claimed by powerful spell casters. They
are nearly invisible when in a forested area, surprising their enemies
on a 1-5 on 1d6. They are immune to mundane weapons and all magic,
except fire and fire-based spells, which inflict normal damage.

Gorgon

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 8

*Attacks*: Gore (1d6+1)

*Special*: Stone breath

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 10/1,400

Gorgons are bull-like creatures with dragon-like scales. Their breath
turns people to stone (60 foot range, saving throw applies).

Grey Ooze

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Strike

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 1

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Grey ooze is almost identical to wet rock, but is a slimy, formless
substance that devours prey and carrion with its acidic secretions,
lashing forward to strike enemies. Grey ooze is immune to spells, heat,
and cold damage. Metal (but not stone or wood) must make a saving throw
vs. acid when exposed to grey ooze (even if the contact is as brief as
the strike of a sword) or be rotted through. When the grey ooze hits a
character in metal armor, the armor must make an item saving throw. Only
cutting and piercing damages a grey ooze—it is impervious to blunt or
crushing attacks.

Green Slime

Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous
hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or organic
substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving throw). It
can be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation process
can be arrested by the use of the spell Cure Disease.

Griffon

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 7

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Flight

*Move*: 12/30 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Griffons have the body of a lion, with the wings, head, and fore-talons
of an eagle. These creatures can be tamed and ridden as mounts. They
usually nest in high mountain aeries, where they lay their eggs and hunt
their prey. Because the fledglings can be tamed, young griffons and
griffon eggs command a very high price in the marketplaces of the great
cities, or to barons and wizards.

Harpy

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Talons

*Special*: Flight, siren song

*Move*: 6/18 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Harpies have the upper body of a human female and the lower body and
wings of a vulture. Their song is a charm that draws its victims to the
harpy (saving throw applies), and the harpy’s touch casts the equivalent
of a Charm Person spell (again, saving throw applies).

Hell Hound

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 4–7

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Breathes fire

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 5/240; 6/400; 7/600; 8/800

Hell hounds are fire-breathing dogs of the underworlds or lower planes.
In addition to biting, they can breathe fire each round, inflicting 2 HP
damage per hit die (10 foot range, saving throw for half damage).

Hippogriff

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 3+1

*Attacks*: Claws

*Special*: Flight

*Move*: 12/36 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 3/60

The hippogriff is similar to a griffon, having the head, foreclaws, and
wings of an eagle, but instead of the body of a lion, it has the body of
a horse. The poem Orlando Furioso (written in 1516) suggests that the
hippogriff is the offspring of a griffon and a horse—but they are
apparently an independent breed, for folkloric tradition holds that
griffons frequently attack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not as hard to
train as griffons—again, from Orlando Furioso:

“Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair, The wizard thought but how
to tame the foal; And, in a month, instructed him to bear Saddle and
bit, and gallop to the goal; And execute on earth or in mid air, All
shifts of manege, course and caracole…”

Hobgoblin

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 1+1

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Hobgoblins are simply large goblins, possibly a separate breed living
apart from their smaller cousins. As a matter of the campaign’s
flavoring, the Referee might choose to make hobgoblins the “fey” goblins
of Irish legend, while regular goblins are the more Tolkien-style
underground-dwellers.

Horse

Horses are AC 7 \[12\], with riding horses having 2 HD and a Move of 24
and warhorses having 3 HD and a Move of 18. Draft horses have a Move of
12.

Humans

Humans are such a versatile race that any number of “monsters” and NPCs
can be made from them. Berserker warriors, tribesmen, cavemen,
princesses, evil high priests, captains of the guard, foot-soldiers, and
tavern-keepers are all different human “monsters.”

Don’t try to build your non-player characters according to the rules for
player characters. Here are some samples, otherwise just make up their
stats and abilities as you see fit.

Human, Bandit

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 1

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Bandits are roving groups of thieves, sometimes organized into small
armies led by more powerful bandit chiefs and captains with higher hit
dice.

Human, Berserker

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 1+2

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: Berserking

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 2/30

Berserkers are normal humans, but they fight with astounding ferocity. A
bonus of +2 is added to their attack rolls. They do not wear armor
heavier than leather armor.

Human, Sergeant-at-Arms

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 3/60

Human sergeants are normally found in command of 1d6+5 human soldiers.
These are the leaders of city guard units and other small military
groups in castles and armies.

Human, Soldier

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 1

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Human soldiers serve as city guard, mercenaries, and men-at-arms. They
are generally armed with leather armor and a mace, sword, or spear. For
every five city guards there is usually a sergeant.

Hydra

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 5–12 (equals \# of heads)

*Attacks*: 5–12 bites

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 6/400; 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000;
13/2,300

Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-like creatures with 5–12 heads.
Each head has one hit die of its own, and when the head is killed, that
head dies. The body has as many hit dice as the total of the heads, so
it is a matter of good strategy for adventurers to focus either on
killing heads (when all the heads are dead the body dies) or killing the
creature by attacking the body (in which case the heads die, too).
Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate their heads are known to exist.

Invisible Stalker

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 8

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Flight, invisibility

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100

Invisible stalkers are generally only found as a result of the spell
Invisible Stalker. They are invisible flying beings created to follow a
single command made by the caster.

Kobold

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 1/2

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: &lt; 1/10

Kobolds are subterranean, vaguely goblin-like humanoids. They have a -1
“to-hit” penalty when fighting above ground. Many use slings or short
bows, and they fight with short swords or spiked clubs in melee combat.

Kraken

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 15

*Attacks*: Tentacle (2d6) or Bite (4d6)

*Special*: Swallow Whole

*Move*: 15 swimming

*HDE/XP*: 15/3200

These massive sea monsters resemble unimaginably large squids with eight
(or more) wiggling appendages. They attack entire vessels, ripping them
apart and swallowing crew whole with their massive, tooth filled maw.
When a kraken attacks, it grabs a target with one of its tentacles on
round one, attempts to bite them on round two, and then swallows them
whole on round three. A target who has been swallowed whole is slain.
Krakens typically have eight tentacles and can make an attack with each
one of them every combat round.

Lich

*Armor Class*: 0 \[19\]

*Hit Dice*: 12–18

*Attacks*: Touch

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 15/2,900; 16/3,200; 17/3,500; 18/3,800; 19/4,100; 20/4,400;
21/4,700

Liches are the undead remnants of wizards, either made undead by their
own deliberate acts during life or as the result of other magical forces
(possibly including their own magics gone awry). A lich has the same
spell-casting powers as the original Magic-user (the same level as the
lich’s HD). A lich’s touch causes paralysis with no saving throw, and
the very sight of one of these dread creatures causes paralysis in any
being of 4 HD or below. Liches are highly malign and intelligent.

Lizardman

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 2+1

*Attacks*: Claw or sword

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6/12 (when swimming)

*HDE/XP*: 2/30

Lizardmen are reptilian humanoids, usually living in tribal villages in
the depths of fetid swamps. Some can hold their breath for a long
duration (an hour or more), while others can actually breathe
underwater. Some lizardmen wield a wicked sword made of sharp bone.

Lycanthropes

Lycanthropes are were-creatures, particularly those in whom the disease
permits assumption of a hybrid form of the human and animal. They cannot
be hit by normal weapons; only silver or magical weapons inflict damage
on them. If any character is brought below 50% hit points by a
lycanthrope, the character will become a lycanthrope himself.

Lycanthrope, Werebear

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 7+3

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6+1)

*Special*: Lycanthropy

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Werebears are often found in temperate forests.

Lycanthrope, Wererat

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: Control rats, lycanthropy

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Wererats are mostly found in cities, lurking in shadowy alleyways.
Wererats can control rats, and are extremely stealthy (surprising
opponents 1–4 on a d6).

Lycanthrope, Werewolf

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Bite or Claw

*Special*: Lycanthropy

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Werewolves are the traditional Lycanthropes seen in horror movies. They
are often only affected by silver or magical weapons, and are often
humanoid—except for during a full moon, and so on.

Manticore

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 6+4

*Attacks*: Bite (1d6+1), or Tail-spikes (1d6)

*Special*: Flight

*Move*: 12/8(when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

A horrid monster with bat wings, the face of a feral human, the body of
a lion, and a tail tipped with 24 iron spikes. The manticore can hurl up
to 6 of the iron spikes from its tail per round, at a maximum range of
180 feet.

Medusa

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\]

*Hit Dice*: 6

*Attacks*: Poisoned bite or weapon

*Special*: Petrifying gaze

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Medusae are horrid creatures from Greek mythology with a female face but
hair of writhing snakes; they have no legs, but the body of a serpent.
The gaze of a medusa turns anyone looking upon it into stone. In
addition to the medusa’s relatively weak melee-weapon attack, the
snake-hair makes one attack per round, causing no damage but lethally
poisonous with a successful hit (saving throw applies).

Minotaur

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 6+4

*Attacks*: Weapon (1d6+1)

*Special*: Never lost in labyrinths

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 6/400

The minotaur is a human-eating predator from Greek mythology, with the
head of a bull and the body of a massive human, covered in shaggy hair.
Sometimes they wield large axes and most are not particularly
intelligent.

Mummy

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 5+1

*Attacks*: Touch (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 7/600

Mummies cannot be hit by normal weapons and even magical weapons inflict
only half damage against them. Their touch also inflicts a rotting
disease which prevents magical healing and causes wounds to heal at
one-tenth of the normal rate. A Cure Disease spell can increase healing
rate to half normal, but a Remove Curse spell is required to completely
lift the mummy’s curse.

Nightsteed

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 5+5

*Attacks*: Flaming Hooves (2d6)

*Special*: Fearful Cry

*Move*: 15 (18 when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 5/600

A nightsteed is a black horse with burning red eyes and a mane of fire.
Its hooves also burn with hellfire and it can fly as easily as run. They
attack with their flaming hooves, and once per day can let out a
terrible cry that requires all who hear it to make a saving throw or
flee in terror of the nightsteed for 1d6 rounds.

Nymph

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: None

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 2/120

Nymphs are fey who appear as leaf-clad or nude women of unimaginable
beauty. They dwell in the deep parts of the forest and seek to protect
wild places in the world. Any men who gaze upon them must make a saving
throw at a -4 penalty or fall completely under their thrall. Nymphs will
lead wayward travelers away from their beloved woods and malicious foes
to their deaths, often drowning them in woodland lakes while they are
enchanted. Nymphs are invisible while in the woods as long as they
remain still, blending seamlessly into their surroundings.

Ochre Jelly

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\]

*Hit Dice*: 5

*Attacks*: Acid strike

*Special*: Lightning divides creature

*Move*: 3

*HDE/XP*: 6/400

Ochre jellies are amorphous oozes that damage opponents with their
acidic surface. They dissolve any adventurers they kill, making the
spell Raise Dead all but impossible.

Ogre

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 4+1

*Attacks*: Weapon (1d6+1)

*Special*: None

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Ogres are normally quite stupid, but more intelligent versions might be
encountered here and there. Sometimes ogres are mistaken for trolls.

Ogre Mage

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 5+4

*Attacks*: Weapon (1d6+1)

*Special*: Magic

*Move*: 12/18 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 7/600

The ogre mage is an ogre with magic powers, based on Japanese legend. An
ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per the spell), create a 10 foot
radius circle of magical darkness, change into human form, cast Sleep
and Charm Person once per day, and cast a cone of frost with a range of
60 feet to a base of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any caught within
(saving throw applies). Western folklore also contains many examples of
shape-shifting, magical ogres (the most famous example being the one in
Puss-in-Boots), so there might be many different types of magical ogres,
whether or not they are called “ogre mage.”

Orc

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 1

*Attacks*: Weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Orcs are stupid, brutish humanoids that gather in tribes of hundreds.
Most are subterranean dwellers, and fight with a -1 penalty “to-hit” in
sunlight. Occasionally, war-bands or even entire tribes of orcs issue
forth from their caverns to raid and pillage by night. Orcish leaders
are great brutes with additional HD, and magic-using shamans may also be
found in the larger tribes. Orcish tribes hate each other, and will
fight savagely unless restrained by a powerful and feared commander,
such as an evil high priest or a mystic sorcerer.

Pegasus

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 2+2

*Attacks*: Hooves

*Special*: Flight

*Move*: 24/42 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Pegasus was the winged horse from Greek mythology. Other Pegasus
creatures might have bat wings, some might be chaotic; such choices are
left entirely up to the Referee.

Purple Worm

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 15

*Attacks*: Bite (2d6) or sting

*Special*: Poison sting

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 17/3,500

Purple worms are massive annelids that grow 40+ feet in length and
sometimes exceed 10 feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing
tunnels in rock (or through sand, in deserts, where they are a tan
color). These beasts swallow their prey whole on a roll 4 higher than
the needed number, or if the worm rolls double the number required
“to-hit”. They can swallow anything the size of a horse or smaller.

In addition to the worm’s dreaded bite, it has a poison stinger on its
tail, the length of a sword and just as deadly even from the piercing
wound it inflicts. The poison injected by the stinger is lethal if the
victim fails a saving throw. What prey the purple worms once hunted (or
perhaps still do, in deep places) with such natural weapons must have
been terrifying indeed. Aquatic versions of the purple worm might also
exist.

Rat, Giant

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 1-1

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: 5% are diseased

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: &lt; 1/10

Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat
or a lynx. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease. A
saving throw vs. poison is allowed. The effects of the disease are
decided by the Referee.

Roc

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 12

*Attacks*: Claw (1d6+2)

*Special*: None

*Move*: 3/48 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 12/2,000

Rocs are the mythological great birds of legend, large enough to prey
upon elephants. They can be trained as fledglings to serve as steeds, so
roc eggs or fledglings would be a prize indeed, worth great sums of
gold. Rocs might grow as large as 18 HD, with commensurately increased
statistics.

Salamander

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\], 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 7

*Attacks*: Constrict or touch

*Special*: Heat, constriction

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Salamanders are intelligent creatures of the elemental planes of fire.
They have the upper body of a human (AC 5 \[14\]) and the lower body of
a snake (AC 3 \[16\]), and give off tremendous, intense heat. The very
touch of a salamander deals 1d6 hit points of fire damage, and they wrap
their tails around foes to cause an additional 2d6 points of crushing
damage per round. Salamanders cannot be enslaved in the same manner
djinn and efreet might be.

Sea Serpent

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 30

*Attacks*: Bite (3d6)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 18 (when swimming)

*HDE/XP*: 30/8,400

The size and nature of sea serpents is a matter for the Referee to
determine. The sea serpent depicted here would be about medium size,
about 60 feet in length, with smaller ones being half that size (with
adjusted statistics, of course), and large ones being about 50% larger
than the one described here. A sea serpent would undoubtedly be capable
of swallowing a human whole, probably on a natural attack roll of 14 or
greater. A character swallowed whole would be digested within, perhaps,
three hours.

Shadow

*Armor Class*: 7 \[12\]

*Hit Dice*: 3+3

*Attacks*: Touch (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 4/130

Shadows may or may not be undead creatures: they are immune to sleep and
charm, but the Referee may decide whether they are undead creatures
subject to turning or whether they are some horrible “other” thing, a
manifestation perhaps, or a creature from another dimension. Shadows are
dark and resemble shadows, though they may be darker. They are not
corporeal, and can only be harmed with magical weapons or by spells.
Their chill touch drains one point of strength with a successful hit,
and if a victim is brought to a strength of 0, he becomes a shadow.
Strength points return after 90 minutes.

Sidhe

*Armor Class*: 3 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 5

*Attacks*: Fey Blade (2d6)

*Special*: See Below

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 7/600

Sidhe are noble fey who rarely travel the mortal realm. They appear as
tall elfin beings of amazing beauty and are clad in shining mail and
glorious raiment. All who looks upon them are struck blind by their
beauty unless a successful saving throw is made. Sidhe attack with their
magical fey blades which do 2d6 points of damage and may cast Alter
Time, Invisibility, and Phantasmal Force each once per day. They are
also highly resistant to mortal magic and have a +5 bonus to all saving
throws made to resist it.

Skeleton

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\], 7 \[12\] w/ shield

*Hit Dice*: 1/2

*Attacks*: Strike or weapon

*Special*: None

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

Skeletons are animated bones of the dead and are usually under the
control of some evil master.

Slug, Giant

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\]

*Hit Dice*: 12

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: Spits acid (2d6)

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 13/2,300

These tremendously large masses of slimy, rubbery flesh are completely
immune to blunt weapons. In addition to their powerful bite, giant slugs
can spit their acidic saliva (one target at a time). The base range for
spitting is 60 feet, and within this range the slug’s spittle will be
50% likely “to-hit” (no “to-hit” roll required). For every additional 10
feet of range, the chance “to-hit” decreases by 10%. On its first
spitting attack, the slug only has a 10% chance “to-hit” within 60 feet,
and no chance of hitting beyond that range. Some giant slugs might have
more or less virulent acidity (thus changing the damage inflicted).

Spectre

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 6

*Attacks*: Touch (See below)

*Special*: Drains 2 levels per hit

*Move*: 15/30 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100

Spectres are wraith-like undead creatures without corporeal bodies. When
a spectre hits an opponent, either with hand or weapon, the touch drains
two levels from the victim. Only magical weapons can damage a spectre.
In some cases, these terrifying creatures may be mounted upon living
beasts, if the beasts have been trained to tolerate proximity to the
undead. Any being killed (or drained below level 0) by a specter becomes
a spectre himself—a pitiful thrall to its creator.

Spider, Giant

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 2+2

*Attacks*: Bite (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 18

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Giant spiders are aggressive hunters. Only the greater giant spiders are
web builders. Giant spider webs require a saving throw to avoid becoming
stuck. Those who make their saving throw can fight and move (5 feet per
round) in the webs. Giant spiders surprise on a roll of 1–5, being able
to hide well in shadows. A giant spider’s bite is very poisonous.

Stirge

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 1-1

*Attacks*: Sting (1d6-1)

*Special*: Suck Blood

*Move*: 15 while flying

*HDE/XP*: 1/15

These tiny birds have needle-like beaks which they use to impale their
victims and then drain them of blood. Whenever a stirge makes a
successful melee attack they remain attached to their target and
automatically inflict 1d6-1 points of damage each round as they drink
the victim's blood.

Treant

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 7–12

*Attacks*: Strike

*Special*: Control trees

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000

Treants are tree-like protectors and “shepherds” of forest trees.
Depending upon their size, they have different hit dice and damage;
treants of 7 to 8 hit dice inflict 2d6 points of damage with each strike
of their branch-like hands, treants of 9–10 hit dice inflict 3d6 points,
and treants of 11–12 hit dice inflict 4d6 points. All treants can “wake”
trees within 60 feet, allowing them to walk at a rate of 3, and possibly
to attack (no more than two trees at a time can be awake at the behest
of a single treant).

Troll

*Armor Class*: 4 \[15\]

*Hit Dice*: 6+3

*Attacks*: Claw (1d6+2)

*Special*: Regeneration

*Move*: 12

*HDE/XP*: 8/800

Trolls are as tall as ogres and just as strong. Unlike ogres, however,
they attack with claws and teeth instead of weapons. Trolls regenerate,
which is to say that any damage inflicted upon them heals within minutes
(3 hit points per round). The only way to utterly kill a troll is to
submerse it in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-grow lopped-off heads
and limbs.

Unicorn

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Hoof or horn

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 24

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Unicorns are generally shy and benevolent creatures, who will only allow
a chaste maiden to approach them. They can teleport once per day to a
distance of 360 feet, with a rider. When they charge, their horn can
deal double damage. Unicorns are 25% resistant to magic. The unicorn’s
horn has healing properties according to legend (the details of this, if
any, are left to the Referee). There is considerable room to create
variants of sorts: evil or flying unicorns, etc.

Vampire

*Armor Class*: 2 \[17\]

*Hit Dice*: 7–9

*Attacks*: Bite (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 12/18 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700

Vampires are some of the most powerful of undead creatures. They can
only be hit with magic weapons and when “killed” in this way they change
into a gaseous form, returning to their coffins.

They regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round, can turn into
gaseous form or into a giant bat at will, and can summon a horde of bats
or 3d6 wolves out from the night. Looking into a vampire’s eyes
necessitates a saving throw at -2, or the character is charmed (as per
the spell Charm Person). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s bite drains two
levels from the victim.

Fortunately, vampires have some weaknesses. They can be killed (these
are the only known methods) by immersing them in running water, exposing
them to sunlight, or driving a wooden stake through the heart. They
retreat from the smell of garlic, the sight of a mirror, or the sight of
“good” holy symbols. Any human killed by a vampire becomes a vampire
under the control of its creator. This description will be recognized
easily as the “Dracula” type of vampire.

Many other possibilities for vampires exist in folklore: Chinese
vampires, for instance, and blood-drinkers more feral than intelligent.
Plus, other cultural templates with different attributes could be
created—how about an ancient Egyptian mummified vampire, or an Aztec
vampire?

Wight

*Armor Class*: 5 \[14\]

*Hit Dice*: 3

*Attacks*: Claw (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 9

*HDE/XP*: 5/240

Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and burial mounds (barrows). They are
undead, and thus not affected by sleep or charm spells. Wights are
immune to all non-magical weapons, with the exception of silver weapons.
Any human killed or completely drained of levels (1 level per hit) by a
wight becomes a wight.

Worg

*Armor Class*: 6 \[13\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Bite

*Special*: None

*Move*: 18

*HDE/XP*: 4/120

Worgs are large, intelligent, and evil wolves of chaos. They are
sometimes ridden by orcs. They may have supernatural origins.

Wraith

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 4

*Attacks*: Touch (See below)

*Special*: See below

*Move*: 24

*HDE/XP*: 6/400

Wraiths are powerful wights, immune to all non-magical weapons other
than silver ones (which inflict only half damage). Arrows are
particularly ineffective against them, for even magical and silver
arrows inflict only one hit point of damage per hit. They drain 1 level
per hit. Wraiths can be found riding well-trained battle steeds or more
unusual mounts that will tolerate their presence.

Wyvern

*Armor Class*: 3 \[16\]

*Hit Dice*: 7

*Attacks*: Bite or sting

*Special*: Flight, poison sting

*Move*: 6/24 (when flying)

*HDE/XP*: 9/1,100

A wyvern is the two-legged form of dragon, and these creatures are
smaller and less intelligent than true four-legged dragons, not to
mention that they do not have a breath weapon. Wyverns have a poisonous
sting at the end of their tails, but they are not coordinated enough to
attack with both bite and sting in a single round. In any given round,
the wyvern is 60% likely to use its tail, which can lash out to the
creature’s front even farther than its head can reach.

Yellow Mold

*Armor Class*: N/A

*Hit Dice*: N/A

*Attacks*: See below

*Special*: Poisonous spores

*Move*: 0

*HDE/XP*: 3/60

Yellow mold is a subterranean fungus; it neither moves nor attacks.
However, if it is poked or struck, it may (50% chance) release a cloud
of poisonous spores, roughly 10 feet in diameter. Failing a saving throw
against the spores means that the character dies a rather horrible
death. Touching yellow mold causes 1d6 points of acid damage. These
growths can be destroyed with fire.

Zombie

*Armor Class*: 8 \[11\], 7 \[12\] w/ shield

*Hit Dice*: 1

*Attacks*: Strike or weapon

*Special*: Immune to sleep, charm

*Move*: 6

*HDE/XP*: 2/30

Zombies are mindless creatures, the walking dead. These are merely
animated corpses, not carriers of any sort of undead contagion as ghouls
are. If their undeath is contagious, they should be worth a few more
experience points than described here, and if a single hit from a zombie
causes contagion or any other sort of disease they should be worth
considerably more experience. However, the standard zombie is simply a
corpse animated to do its creator’s bidding.

Tougher Monsters

There is really no limit as to how high monsters can go, and often it’s
fun to trick the players by throwing über-monsters at them. The Referee
should feel free to adjust AC, HD, or other factors to make monsters
more challenging. Also, feel free to try new options like a super strain
of orcs, goblin spider-riders, or fire-resistant mummies just to keep
the players on their toes.

Monster Levels

You may notice that while suggested character levels are capped, monster
levels are not. The reasons for this are simple:

1.  Players run in packs and big monsters need levels to overcome a
    disadvantage in numbers.

2.  Players tend to be creative while many Referees allow monsters to
    “play stupid.”

The Referee has the option of allowing characters to continue to
advance, or to put a cap on monster levels as he or she sees fit.

Creating Monsters

Monsters are not Player Characters, and their abilities are not at all
determined by the rules for PCs—not even the stats for races that can
have player characters, such as Dwarves. A monster’s abilities are
determined by the Referee, not by any rules! Feel free to add wings,
breath weapons, extra hit dice, wounded versions, or whatever suits your
adventure and your campaign. Toggle and tweak, imagine and invent! You
are responsible for the quality of the swords and sorcery in your game,
not the rules. So don’t try to create monsters according to any sort of
power formula. Create monsters based on how they feel and how they play
at the gaming table. Create challenges for the players, not headaches
for yourself. Your job is to imagine and create, not to slave at
rulebooks finding out what you’re “allowed” to do.

Chapter 9: Treasure

The amount of treasure a monster owns or guards is usually related to
the monster’s HDE. That’s not necessarily realistic, but keep in mind
that treasure is one of the ways the game reflects what a character has
done: it’s used in awarding experience points. Too many large treasures
and the characters will become powerful without actually having done
very much. Too many monsters with small treasures and the characters
won’t gain levels to reflect their achievements.

As a general guideline, the monetary value of a treasure ought to be
about 2–3 times the monster’s value in experience points, and keep in
mind that hunting and patrolling monsters likely won’t be carting their
treasure around with them. If the characters can’t find the monster’s
lair, they may get none of the treasure. Also, it obviously doesn’t make
sense for every wild boar and wolf to have a cache of treasure hidden
away somewhere. Averaging the treasure out over several of the monsters
in an adventure is a good way of making sure the characters get the
right amount of experience points from treasure. Perhaps the goblin
treasure hoard contains some “extra” treasure to account for the wolves
in the area. If the characters avoid the wolves and kill the goblins, so
much the better. If they have to fight the wolves and never find the
goblins, then the treasure is there for them to find next time.

Here is a table a Referee can use as a guideline to help create a
treasure:

| Table 44: Treasure Value |                   |        |        |        |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Roll                     | **Total Value**\* | **CP** | **SP** | **GP** |
| 1                        | XP × 1            | 50%    | 30%    | 20%    |
| 2–3                      | XP × 2            | 20%    | 50%    | 30%    |
| 4–5                      | XP × 3            | 10%    | 40%    | 50%    |
| 6                        | XP × 4            | –      | 25%    | 75%    |

\* The total value of treasure is expressed in terms of gold coins. If
the total value of treasure was 100 XP on a roll of 1, the recipient
would receive 20 gp, 300 sp, and 5,000 cp

Remember that coins found are not always gold pieces—there might be a
mixture of copper (cp) and silver pieces (sp) in the treasure as well.
The treasure breakdown given in the prior Treasure Values table is a
suggested guideline to how you might consider breaking up the treasure.
One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces
(cp).

Splitting the Take

Once the monsters are slain and the wounds are bound, it’s time to
divide up the treasure. It is suggested that the total gp value of the
loot is totaled and divided up among the participants with each getting
an equal “share.” Many Referees rule that treasure must be shared with
NPCs getting either a full or half share, depending upon their level. It
is also customary for fallen (dead) companions to still get a share of
the take to be given to their next of kin.

Treasure Items

In addition to coins, treasures might contain gems, jewelry, and magical
items. Treasures should be interesting—an endless series of “another
treasure worth 100 gp in total” is a sure-fire recipe for boring your
players.

For every 5,000 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 5,000
gp for an item on either the Major Gem/Jewelry or Major Magic table.

For every 1,000 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 1,000
gp for an item on either the Medium Gem/Jewelry or Medium Magic table.

For every 100 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 100 gp
for an item on either the Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table.

Calculate the total percentage of treasure that can be traded out and
roll a d100 to see if you can roll for an item on one of the following
tables. It is suggested that the Referee begin with the 5,000 gp values
and work down to the 100 gp values. “Jewelry” refers to a single item of
jewelry.

Always remember that these tables are merely guidelines—if you desire
the placement of a particular item or treasure type, go ahead and do it!
If you don’t wish to include gems, jewelry, or magic items, then leave
the treasure at coins. These tables are here only to help when wanted.

Treasure Trade Out (Example \#1)

If you populate an area with 5 skeletons, their total XP value would be
75. If you were to roll against the Treasure Values table and get a 4,
the total treasure value for that encounter is 225 gp and the break out
would be (rounded down): 112 gp, 900 sp, and 2,250 cp. There is a 10%
chance of trading out 100 gp of that treasure for one minor item. If, on
a d100, you roll under 10%, then the treasure value of that encounter
would be 12 gp, 900 sp, 2,250 cp, and one minor item (as rolled on the
Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table).

Treasure Trade Out (Example \#2)

You place a fearsome minotaur in a locked dungeon room for a total of
400 XP. Rolling against the Treasure Values table, if you were to roll a
6, the total treasure value for this encounter is 1,600 gp and the break
out would be: 1,200 gp and 4,000 sp. There is a 10% chance of trading
out 1,000 gp of that treasure for one medium item. If, on a d100, you
roll under 10%, then the treasure value on that encounter would be 200
gp, 4,000 sp, and one medium item (as rolled on the Medium Gem/Jewelry
or Medium Magic table). With the remaining total value in gold, there
could either be a 60% chance to trade out 600 gp for one minor item, six
10% chances to trade out 600 gp for a total of six minor items, or some
other variant like one 10% chance to trade out 100 gp for one minor item
(keeping the remaining 500 gp).

Greater Ring Descriptions

**Djinn Summoning**: The wearer of this ring can summon a djinn.

**Human Control**: Allows the wearer to cast Charm Person once per day
and maintain the charm on up to 3 individuals at a time.

**Regeneration**: The wearer regenerates 1 HP/round and thus cannot die
unless the ring is removed or the body burned.

**Shooting Stars**: Once per day, this ring can summon 1d6 flaming
meteors from the depths of space. Each meteor can target a separate
enemy and deals 3d6 damage. If used indoors or underground, the meteors
will strike whatever is directly above the target.

**Spell Storing (Magic-user)**: The ring contains 1d6 Magic-user spells.
Roll 1d6 for each spell to determine their spell levels. The wearer (if
a Magic-user) can cast these spells as if they were his own memorized
and prepared spells. Once the spell is cast, it cannot be cast a second
time until the caster rests for 8 hours.

**Spell Storing (Cleric)**: The ring contains 1d6 Cleric spells. Roll
1d6 for each spell to determine their spell levels (re-roll a 6). The
wearer (if a Cleric) can cast these spells as if they were his own
memorized and prepared spells. Once the spell is cast, it cannot be cast
a second time until the caster rests for 8 hours.

**Spell Turning**: Any spell (other than from a wand, etc.) directly
aimed at the wearer of this ring is partially reflected back at the
caster. Roll a d100 to determine how much of the spell’s power bounces
back; the exact determination of what happens is up to the Referee.

**Telekinesis**: The wearer can mentally lift and move up to 200 pounds
of weight at a range of 120 feet.

**Three Wishes**: Grants the wearer 3 wishes; outrageous wishes
backfire.

**X-ray Vision**: The wearer has x-ray vision at a range of 40 feet. The
maximum distance through which the character can see through solid rock
is just over 10 feet, though solid metals (other than lead) is 1 foot,
and through lead is 1 inch.

| 10               | Lordly Might |

Staff Descriptions

**Absorption**: Absorbs spells cast directly at the wielder and allows
the wielder to cast a spell from his own memory using that power (and
thus not losing the spell from memory). Once the staff has absorbed 50
levels of spells (whether or not the power has been cast back out
again), it no longer absorbs spells.

**Beguiling**: Casts Charm Person in a radius of 20 feet from the
wielder (uses one charge). The duration of the charm is 1 hour.

**Command**: A charge can be used to control humans (as per Charm
Person), plants, or animals.

**Healing**: Cures 1d6+1 hit points of damage per charge.

**Power**: Casts Light (no charge used), casts Fireball (4d6 damage),
cold as a Wand of Cold, Lightning Bolt (4d6 damage), acts as a ring of
Telekinesis (costs one charge) and hits for 2d6 damage (no charge used).

**Lordly Might**: These staves only carry 10 charges, but a charge may
be used to cast Raise Dead.

**Snake, the**: +1 “to-hit” and +1 damage. When commanded (by using a
charge) the staff coils around the target with a successful hit and
pinions the victim for 1d4 × 10 minutes. The victim must be about the
size of a human or smaller to use this power. The staff will slither
back to its owner afterwards at a speed of 24. Only Clerics can employ a
Staff of the Snake.

**Striking**: Inflicts 2d6 points of damage with a successful hit (does
not use charges).

**Withering**: Adds ten years of physical aging with a successful hit.

**Wizardry**: The most powerful of staves. It is a staff of power with
additional abilities. At the cost of one charge, it allows invisibility,
summoning elementals (calling 1d4 at a time), Hold Person, a Wall of
Fire, Passwall, a Web spell, or Fly.

**Staff Charges**

Most staffs carry 200 charges

the wearer to make prodigious leaps 10 feet high and up to 30 feet
horizontally. These boots also double movement rates, but outdoors only.
They do not require the wearer to rest after using them. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Bracers of Defense, AC 4 \[15\] or AC 2 \[17\] (50% chance)**: These
bracers improve the wearer’s armor class (whatever part of it is due to
actual armor) to the stated level—there is no effect if the wearer is
already armored to the same or higher degree. The AC granted by the
bracers can be increased by magical rings or other protective magics.
Usable by: All Classes.

**Bracers of Defense, AC 6 \[13\]**: These bracers improve the wearer’s
armor class (whatever part of it is due to actual armor) to the stated
level—there is no effect if the wearer is already armored to the same or
higher degree. The AC granted by the bracers can be increased by magical
rings or other protective magics. Usable by: All Classes.

**Carpet of Flying**: The carpet can carry as many as three people, and
travels at a speed of 18 when it has more than one passenger. With only
one rider, the carpet moves at a rate of 30. Usable by: All Classes.

**Censer, Bowl, Brazier, or Stone of Controlling Elementals**: Censers
control air elementals, bowls (when filled) control water elementals,
braziers control fire elementals, and Stones control earth elementals.
These items can be used to summon a 12 HD elemental of the appropriate
type. Generally, it takes 10 minutes to prepare the object for use.
Usable by: Magic-users.

**Chime of Opening**: Sounding this small chime opens any door, even if
the door is barred or Wizard Locked. Usable by: All Classes.

**Cloak of Displacement**: The wearer appears to be in a slightly
different location than he really is. His AC improves by 2, and he gains
a +2 saving throw against any targeted attack upon him. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Cloak of Elvenkind**: The wearer is almost, but not quite, invisible.
Usable by: All Classes.

**Cloak of Protection, +1**: This cloak improves the wearer’s AC by 1,
and grants a bonus of +1 on saving throws. Usable by: All but Fighters.

**Cloak of Protection, +2 or +3 (50%)**: This cloak improves the
wearer’s armor class by 2 (or 3), and grants a bonus of +2 (or +3) on
saving throws. Usable by: All but Fighters.

**Crystal Ball**: Allows the user to see what he desires to see, over a
considerable distance. A crystal ball may not be used more than thrice
per day, or the user will be driven mad. Certain spells and other
precautions may be used to prevent being seen through a crystal ball.
Some crystal balls communicate sound or even thoughts from the area
being scryed, although these are rare. Usable by: Magic-users.

**Cursed Item**: (See Cursed Items)

**Decanter of Endless Water**: This jug pours out one gallon of water
per minute when unstoppered. Usable by: All Classes.

**Deck of Many Things**: An ordinary-seeming deck of hand-painted cards,
this item bears tremendous and varied enchantments, one per card in the
deck. The deck contains all the aces and face cards, plus one Joker (the
Fool). A character may draw as many cards as he likes (with the deck
re-shuffled each time), but once he stops drawing cards, the deck
disappears in a sound of faintly malevolent laughter. The results are as
follows:

**The Hearts** (♥)

*Ace*: Gain 50,000 xp.

*King*: Gain a magic item from the Misc. Magic Items (Greater) table.

*Queen*: Gain 1d3 wishes

*Jack*: Gain the ability to summon an 8 HD warrior with +3 sword,
shield, to serve for a total of 1 hour.

**The Clubs** (♣)

*Ace*: The character’s alignment is changed. If the game does not use
alignment, the character receives a dangerous Quest (per the spell).

*King*: The character’s most powerful magic item is sucked into the void
and disappears.

*Queen*: The character is instantly turned to stone, a look of great
surprise upon his face.

*Jack*: The character loses one point from his Prime Attribute.

**The Spades** (♠)

*Ace*: Lose a level of experience

*King*: A warrior with 9 HD, a +4 weapon, +4 shield, and +4 armor
appears and attacks. When he is killed, his body and all his possessions
disappear again.

*Queen*: The character dies instantly.

*Jack*: A random monster, with 1d4+6 HD, attacks the adventurers. The
monster gains one round of surprise, for it appears from thin air.

**The Diamonds** (♦)

*Ace*: Gain a map to a very significant treasure

*King*: Gain 5d6 items of jewelry

*Queen*: Gain a scroll of seven spells, all 2nd level or higher

*Jack*: Add one point to a single attribute of the player’s choice

**The Joker**

Gain 25,000 XP.

**Dust of Appearance or Disappearance (50%)**: Dust of Appearance is
tossed in a radius of 10 feet around the user, and makes any invisible,
astral, displaced, out-of-phase, or dimensional thing completely
visible. The dust generally comes in a pouch, with enough for 20–30
uses. Dust of Disappearance works in the opposite way: when it is
sprinkled in a 10 foot radius, everything therein becomes invisible for
5d6 turns. Normal means of detecting invisibility (such as a Detect
Invisibility spell) are not strong enough to work against the dust’s
powerful enchantment. Usable by: All Classes.

**Dust of Sneezing and Choking**: Pouches containing this dust
ordinarily contain only enough for one “dose.” When scattered in a
radius of 10 feet, the dust causes all in the area to make a saving
throw or die. If the nature of the dust is identified before it is
experimented with, it can be used as a devastating thrown weapon. Usable
by: All Classes.

**Efreeti Bottle**: The efreeti of the bottle will serve the bottle’s
owner for a year and a day unless it is accidentally released from
servitude. Usable by: All Classes.

**Figurine of the Golden Lions**: A small stone figurine that transforms
into a lion when the command word is spoken, fighting at the owner’s
orders. If it is slain, it turns back into a figurine, but may be used
again. The figurine may be used once per week, and no more. Usable by:
All Classes.

**Figurine of the Onyx Dog:** This stone figure transforms into a living
hound of stone when its command word is spoken. It will seek whatever
the owner tells it to find, without stopping until it succeeds or is
killed. It has a 75% chance to detect objects that are invisible or
hidden (and of course its sense of smell detects invisible and hidden
creatures with almost perfect success). For purposes of defense and
attack, the stone dog is treated as a wolf. It may be used twelve times
before the statuette becomes non-magical. Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Dexterity**: When worn, these gloves grant a bonus of +2
to the wearer’s dexterity (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Ogre Power**: These gauntlets raise the wearer’s strength
to that of an ogre. Hit probability is not increased above normal, but
damage bonuses from strength are increased to +4 (not cumulative with
the wearer’s existing strength bonus, if any). Usable by: all but
Magic-users.

**Gauntlets of Swimming and Climbing**: These gloves permit the wearer
to swim at a rate of 18, and climb sheer walls with a 95% chance of
success per ten feet of climbing. Usable by: all but Magic-users.

**Gem of Seeing**: A gem of seeing is used as a lens, and shows the
truth of what it sees, cutting through illusions of all kinds, even very
powerful ones. Usable by: All Classes.

**Girdle of Giant Strength**: This wide belt grants the wearer the
strength of a hill giant (+8 strength damage, not cumulative with any
existing strength bonuses). It does not increase “to-hit” probability.
Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Fiery Brilliance**: This prodigiously powerful helm grants
many benefits to the wearer. He gains a +10 on saving throws against
fire damage, and can create a Wall of Fire himself. Fighters wearing the
helm may command a weapon in hand to flame (+1d6 damage). Magic-users
wearing the helm can add +1 to each die of damage inflicted by a
Fireball spell. Clerics wearing the helm can ignite objects within 30
feet at will, and may cast two Light or Continual Light spells for each
one actually prepared. The wearer of this helm is likely to be attacked
by any air elemental creatures, but fire elemental types (such as efreet
or salamanders) will be favorably disposed toward the wearer. Usable by:
All Classes.

**Helm of Reading Magic and Languages**: The wearer can read all
languages, including magic script. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Teleportation**: When the wearer casts a Teleportation spell
on himself, while wearing the helm, he may teleport himself without
error, anywhere he desires. The helm does not permit the casting of a
Teleportation spell on anyone other than the wearer. Usable by:
Magic-users.

**Hole, Portable**: A piece of dark cloth about five feet in diameter.
It is actually the mouth of an inter-dimensional hole 10 feet deep—items
and people can fall through it or climb down into it once it is placed
on the ground. The piece of cloth can actually be pulled in from the
inside to close the hole off entirely, although there is no source of
fresh air within, and staying inside will asphyxiate the inhabitant in a
short time. The piece of cloth can be picked up and carried off whenever
desired—hence the name “portable.” Usable by: All Classes.

**Horn of Blasting**: This horn, when blown, has the same effect on
structures as a catapult, and causes 2d6 points of damage to creatures,
deafening them for 10 minutes as well. The cone of sound is 100 feet
long, and widens to a base of 20 feet (the “point” of the cone, at the
horn’s mouth, is 10 feet wide). Usable by: All Classes.

**Horn of Valhalla, Bronze**: Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (3 HD) to
assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters and Clerics
only.

**Horn of Valhalla, Iron**: Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (4 HD) to
assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters.

**Horn of Valhalla, Silver**: Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (2 HD) to
assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: All Classes.

**Horseshoes of Speed**: Double a horse’s movement rate. Usable by:
Horses.

**Jug of Alchemy**: This jug produces whatever liquid is desired, in a
commonly used large quantity (e.g., 10 gallons of water, but only five
gallons of wine). It may be used no more than 7 times per day, and will
only produce the liquid first requested in that day. It does not produce
magical liquids. Usable by: All Classes.

**Lenses of Charming**: These lenses, when placed over the eyes, give
the wearer the ability to charm those who look into his eyes (as per a
Charm Person spell). The saving throw against the power of the lenses is
made at -2. Usable by: All Classes.

**Libram, magical (level gain)**: Magical librams grant a level of
experience to the reader, if the reader is of the right class. Randomly
determine the class for which the libram is written.

**Luckstone**: This stone grants +1 to saving throws and “to-hit” rolls.
Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Beneficial Exercise**: Reading this tome increases the
reader’s strength by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All
Classes.

**Manual of Golems**: This book contains the basic instructions and
formulae for creating a single type of golem. The process is expensive,
and the creator must have achieved a certain level of magical expertise
in order to use the book, but these are priceless repositories of
forgotten lore. Such books are often warded, by the original owner, from
the touch of anyone not of the Magic-user class, enchanted to inflict
damage or even the loss of a level. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Manual of Intelligence**: Reading this tome increases the reader’s
intelligence by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Quickness**: Reading this tome increases the reader’s
dexterity by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Wisdom**: Reading this tome increases the reader’s wisdom by
1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Medallion of Detect Thoughts (ESP)**: Functions as a Detect Thoughts
(ESP) spell within 30 feet (75%) or 90 feet (25%). Usable by: All
Classes.

**Mirror of Mental Scrying**: This hand-mirror (it might also be found
as a smaller mirror on a necklace) allows the user to cast
Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, and Detect Thoughts (ESP), with the normal
range, but for an unlimited time. The mirror will also answer a question
about what it portrays (the answer is likely to be quite cryptic), but
only one question per week is possible. Usable by: All Classes.

**Necklace of Fireballs**: This necklace is hung with 3d4 little
baubles. When thrown, the baubles explode into 6d6 fireballs (per the
spell). Usable by: All Classes.

**Pipes of the Sewers**: These pipes summon 10d6 giant rats. The piper
does not need to concentrate once the rats arrive (which takes 1d4 × 10
minutes), but it is wise to do so. When the rats arrive, there is a 5%
chance that they will not obey him, and if he ceases to concentrate on
his tune there is a 10% chance that he will lose control of them. Every
subsequent round in which he fails to concentrate there is another
chance to lose control, and the chance increases by 10% each time it is
made (first round, 10%, second round 20%, etc.). Usable by: All Classes.

**Robe of Blending**: These robes make the wearer appear to be a part of
his surroundings, including the ability to appear as another one of a
group of nearby creatures. He will appear to be a small tree when in
forest surroundings, a sand formation in the desert, etc. Creatures with
10+ hit dice (or levels of experience) have a 10% chance per level (or
HD) above 9th to perceive the wearer as a robed figure rather than a
part of the surroundings. Usable by: All Classes.

**Robe of Eyes**: Hundreds of eyes are woven and embroidered into the
fabric of these magical robes, granting the wearer tremendous powers of
supernatural perception. In a radius of 240 feet, anything he looks upon
is seen for what it is: he sees invisible creatures, he perceives
illusions, and his sight even extends into the astral plane. He cannot
be ambushed or otherwise taken by surprise, and he can follow the trail
of anything that has passed by within the last day. Usable by:
Magic-users only.

**Robe of Wizardry**: This robe grants the wearer the ability to cast
Charm, Polymorph, and Hold Person with a 95% chance of success. The
robes may be tied to specific alignments. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Rope of Climbing**: A 50 foot length of rope that leaps magically
upward and can tie and untie itself upon command. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Rope of Entanglement**: This rope, on command, twines itself around as
many as 2d4+1 human-sized foes. The rope cannot be hit except with a
natural roll of 20 (it is magical), and can sustain 20 hit points of
damage before fraying and becoming useless. Usable by: All Classes.

**Spade of Excavation**: This ordinary-looking spade digs by itself when
commanded, shoveling out 1 cubic yard (3 x 3 x 3) per ten minutes.
Usable by: Fighters.

**Symbol—Scarab of Insanity**: This is a carving of a scarab-beetle, or
perhaps the petrified remains of a real one. When the scarab is
displayed, all creatures with 9 or fewer hit dice, within a radius of 30
feet, fall into temporary insanity lasting for 2 hours. Creatures with
10+ hit dice still do not receive a saving throw, but have a 1 in 4
chance to overcome the scarab’s insidious influence. The scarab may be
used 12 times, after which it crumbles to dust. At the option of the
Referee, it might be recharged but with a 5% chance per charge that the
item will be destroyed. Usable by: All Classes.

Cursed Items

Cursed items come in many shapes and forms—most likely they are ancient
magical items whose magic has deteriorated or changed with age, although
some of them were clearly fashioned to serve as traps for the unwary (or
for the maker’s enemies, perhaps). Note that cursed items cannot usually
be dropped or removed without the assistance of a Remove Curse spell.
Although the Referee is encouraged to create his own cursed items, the
samples on the following page should prove useful guidance:

| Table 70: Cursed Items |                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Roll                   | **Cursed Items**                 |
| 1                      | Bag of Devouring                 |
| 2                      | Censer of Hostile Elementals     |
| 3                      | Cloak of Poison                  |
| 4                      | Crystal Ball of Suggestion       |
| 5                      | Dancing Boots                    |
| 6                      | Flask of Stoppered Curses        |
| 7                      | Horn of Collapse                 |
| 8                      | Medallion of Projecting Thoughts |
| 9                      | Mirror of Opposition             |
| 10                     | Robe of Feeblemindedness         |

Cursed Item Descriptions

**Bag of Devouring**: Functions as a bag of holding, but devours any
item placed into it within 1d4+1 hours.

**Censer of Hostile Elementals**: A censer (or brazier, bowl, or stone)
that summons elementals—but the elementals are hostile instead of under
the summoner’s control.

**Cloak of Poison**: Upon donning this cloak, the wearer’s body is
suffused with magical poisons of many kinds, and dies instantly, without
the chance of a saving throw.

**Crystal Ball of Suggestion**: Does not function as a crystal ball, but
implants a suggestion in the viewer’s mind. Powerful versions of this
item might even implant a Quest.

**Dancing Boots**: These boots function as boots of Elvenkind or speed,
until the wearer is in combat or fleeing. Suddenly at that point he will
begin to dance a jig, or perhaps a stately waltz.

**Flask of Stoppered Curses**: This flask releases a curse of some kind
when its seal is broken.

**Horn of Collapse**: When sounded, this horn causes a blast of
destruction straight upwards, destroying any ceiling overhead and
causing it to collapse.

**Medallion of Projecting Thoughts**: The wearer’s thoughts can be
“heard” by all nearby.

**Mirror of Opposition**: All persons looking into this mirror are
attacked by evil versions of themselves, exact duplicates including
spells and magic items. When the mirror-opposites are slain, their
bodies and equipment disappear into mist, and return to the mirror.

**Robe of Feeblemindedness**: Anyone donning this cloak has his
intelligence reduced to that of a garden snail.

Fight on adventurer!

And may you return home safely.
